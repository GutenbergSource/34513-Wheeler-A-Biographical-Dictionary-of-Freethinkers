<p class="first">John Stuart Mill in his &ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo;
declares with truth that &ldquo;the world would be astonished if it
knew how great a proportion of its brightest ornaments, of those most
distinguished even in popular estimation for wisdom and virtue are
complete sceptics in religion.&rdquo; Many of these, as Mill points
out, refrain from various motives from speaking out. The work I have
undertaken will, I trust, do something to show how many of the
world&rsquo;s worthiest men and women have been Freethinkers.</p>
<p>My Dictionary does not pretend to be a complete list of those who
have rendered services to Freethought. To form such a compilation would
rather be the task of an international society than of an individual.
Moreover details concerning many worthy workers are now inaccessible.
Freethought boasts its noble army of martyrs of whom the world was not
worthy, and who paid the penalty of their freedom in prison or at the
stake. Some of the names of these are only known by the vituperation of
their adversaries. I have done my best to preserve some trustworthy
record of as many as possible.</p>
<p>The only complete work with a similar design of which I have any
knowledge, is the <i lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Ath&eacute;es anciens
et modernes</i>, by Sylvain Mar&eacute;chal with its supplements by
Jerome de Lalande the Astronomer, An. VIII. (1800)&ndash;1805. That
work, which is now extremely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e169"
href="#xd25e169" name="xd25e169">iv</a>]</span>rare, gave scarcely any
biographical details, and unfortunately followed previous orthodox
atheographers, such as Buddeus, Reimmann, Hardouin, Garasse, Mersenne,
in classing as Atheists those to whom the title was inapplicable. I
have taken no names from these sources without examining the
evidence.</p>
<p>A work was issued by Richard Carlile in 1826, entitled <i>A
Dictionary of Modern Anti-Superstionists</i>; or, &ldquo;an account,
arranged alphabetically, of those who, whether called Atheists,
Sceptics, Latitudinarians, Religious Reformers, or etc., have during
the last ten centuries contributed towards the diminution of
superstition. Compiled by a searcher after Truth.&rdquo; The compiler,
as I have reason to know, was Julian Hibbert, who brought to his task
adequate scholarship and leisure. It was, however, conceived on too
extensive a scale, and in 128 pages, all that was issued, it only
reached to the name of Annet. Julian Hibbert also compiled
chronological tables of English Freethinkers, which were published in
the <i>Reasoner</i> for 1855.</p>
<p>Of the <i>Anti-Trinitarian Biography</i> of the Rev. Robert Wallace,
or of the previous compilations of Saudius and Bock, I have made but
little use. To include the names of all who reject some of the
Christian dogmas was quite beside my purpose, though I have included
those of early Unitarians and Universalists who, I conceive, exhibited
the true spirit of free inquiry in the face of persecution. To the
<i lang="de">Freydenker Lexikon</i> of J. A. Trinius (1759) my
obligations are slight, but should be acknowledged. To Bayle&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary</i>, Hoefer&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelle Biographie Generale</i>,
Meyer&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Konversations Lexikon</i>, Franck&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Sciences Philosophiques</i>, and to

"xd25e203">v</a>]</span>also express my indebtedness. In the case of
disputed dates I have usually found Haydn&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary of
Biography</i> (1886) most trustworthy, but I have also consulted
Oettinger&rsquo;s valuable <i lang="fr">Moniteur des Dates</i>.</p>
<p>The particulars have in all cases been drawn from the best available
sources. I have not attempted to give a full view of any of the lives
dealt with, but merely sought to give some idea of their services and
relation to Freethought. Nor have I enumerated the whole of the works
of authors who have often dealt with a variety of subjects. As full a
list as is feasible has, however, been given of their distinctive
Freethought works; and the book will, I hope, be useful to anyone
wishing information as to the bibliography of Freethought. The only
work of a bibliographical kind is the <i lang="fr">Guide du Libre
Penseur</i>, by M. Alfred Verli&egrave;re, but his list is very far
from complete even of the French authors, with whom it is almost
entirely occupied. I should also mention <i lang="fr">La Lorgnette
Philosophique</i>, by M. Paquet, as giving lively sketches, though not
biographies, of some modern French Freethinkers.</p>
<p>In the compilation of my list of names I have received assistance
from my friends, Mr. G. W. Foote (to whom I am also indebted for the
opportunity of publication), Mr. W. J. Birch, Mr. E. Truelove and Mr.
F. Malibran. For particulars in regard to some English Freethinkers I
am indebted to Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake and Mr.
E. T. Craig, while Professor <span class="corr" id="xd25e221" title=
"Corrected by author from: Dal Volta">Dalla Volta</span>, of Florence,
has kindly assisted me with some of the Italian names. I must also
express my indebtedness to A. de Gubernatis, whose <i lang=
"it">Dizionario Biografico degli Scrittori Contemporanei</i><a id=
"xd25e226" name="xd25e226"></a> I have found of considerable service.
My thanks are also due to G. K. Fortescue, Esq., for permission to
examine the titles of all Freethought works in the British Museum.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e228" href="#xd25e228" name=
"xd25e228">vi</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some readers may think my list contains names better omitted, while
omitting others well deserving a place. I have, for instance, omitted
many foreign Liberal Protestants while including Bishop Colenso, who,
ostensibly, did not go so far. But my justification, if any, must be
found in my purpose, which is to record the names of those who have
contributed in their generation to the <i>advance</i> of Freethought.
No one can be more conscious of the imperfections of my work than
myself, but I console myself with the reflection of Plato, that
&ldquo;though it be the merit of a good huntsman to find game in a wide
wood, it is no discredit if he do not find it all&rdquo;; and the hope
that what I have attempted some other will complete.</p>
<p>The most onerous part of my task has been the examination of the
claims of some thousand names, mostly foreign, which find no place in
this dictionary. But the work throughout has been a labor of love. I
designed it as my humble contribution to the cause of Freethought, and
leave it with the hope that it will contribute towards the history of
&ldquo;the good old cause&rdquo;; a history which has yet to be
written, and for which, perhaps, the time is not yet ripe.</p>
<p>Should this volume be received with an encouraging share of favor, I
hope to follow it with a <i>History of Freethought in England</i>, for
which I have long been collecting materials. <span class=

<p><b>Abu-Fazil</b> (<span class="sc">Abu al Fadhl ibn Mubarak</span>,
called <i>Al Hindi</i>), vizier to the great Emperor Akbar from 1572.
Although by birth a Muhammadan, his investigations into the religions
of India made him see equal worth in all, and, like his master, Akbar,
he was tolerant of all sects. His chief work is the <i>Ayin Akbary</i>,
a statistical account of the Indian Empire. It was <span class="corr"

Sulaiman</span>), celebrated Arabian poet, b. at Maari, in Syria, Dec.,
973. His free opinions gave much scandal to devout Moslems. He was
blind through small-pox from the age of four years, but his poems
exhibit much knowledge. He called himself &ldquo;the doubly imprisoned
captive,&rdquo; in allusion to his seclusion and loss of sight. He took
no pains to conceal that he believed in no revealed religion. Died May,
1057, and ordered the following verse to be written on his
tomb:&mdash;&ldquo;I owe this to the fault of my father: none owe the
like to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Abu Tahir</b> (al Karmatti), the chief of a freethinking sect at
Bahrein, on the Persian Gulf, who with a comparatively small number of
followers captured Mecca (930), and took away the black stone. He

Ackerman, who in preparing for the ministry lost his Christian faith,
and who, after becoming teacher to Prince Frederick William (afterwards
Frederick III.), died at the age of thirty-four (1846). Both were
friends of Proudhon. Madame Ackermann&rsquo;s poems (Paris
1863&ndash;74 and 85) exhibit her as a philosophic pessimist and
Atheist. &ldquo;God is dethroned,&rdquo; says M. Caro of her poems
(<i lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, 15 May, 1874). She professes
hatred of Christianity and its interested professors. She has also
published <i>Thoughts of a Solitary</i>. Sainte Beuve calls her

<p><b>Acontius</b> (Jacobus&mdash;<i>Italian</i>, Giacomo Aconzio).
Born at Trent early in sixteenth century. After receiving ordination in
the Church of Rome he relinquished that faith and fled to Switzerland
in 1557. He subsequently came to England and served Queen Elizabeth as
a military engineer. To her he dedicated his <i>Strategems of
Satan</i>, published at Basle 1565. This was one of the earliest
latitudinarian works, and was placed upon the <i>Index</i>. It was also
bitterly assailed by Protestant divines, both in England and on the
Continent. An English translation appeared in 1648. Some proceedings
were taken against Acontius before Bishop Grindall, of the result of
which no account is given. Some passages of Milton&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">Areopagitica</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e393" href=

who, Cheynell informs us, lived till 1623. Stephen&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> says he is believed to have
died shortly after 1566.</p>
<p><b>Acosta</b> (Uriel). Born at Oporto 1597, the son of a

<p><b>Adler</b> (Felix) Ph. D. American Freethinker, the son of a
Jewish rabbi, was b. in Alzey, Germany, 13 Aug. 1851. He graduated at
Columbia College, 1870, was professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature
at Cornell University from &rsquo;74 to May &rsquo;76, when he
established in New York the Society of Ethical Culture, to which he
discourses on Sundays. In 1877 he published a volume entitled <i>Creed
and Deed</i>, in which he rejects supernatural religion. Dr. Adler has
also contributed many papers to the Radical literature of America.</p>
<p><b>&AElig;nesidemus.</b> A Cretan sceptical philosopher of the first
century. He adopted the principle of Heraclitus, that all things were
in course of change, and argued against our knowledge of ultimate

Alnwick 27 July, 1801. Educated at Cambridge, where he became senior
wrangler 1823. During a long life Professor Airy did much to advance
astronomical science. His <i>Notes on the Earlier Hebrew Scriptures</i>
1876, proves him to have been a thorough-going Freethinker.</p>
<p><b>Aitkenhead</b> (Thomas), an Edinburgh student aged eighteen, who
was indicted for blasphemy, by order of the Privy Council, for having
called the Old Testament &ldquo;Ezra&rsquo;s Fables,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e442" href="#xd25e442" name=

the Hague 23 Feb. 1669.</p>
<p id="akbar"><b>Akbar</b> (Jalal-ed-din Muhammad), the greatest of the
emperors of Hindostan, b. 15 Oct. 1542, was famous for his wide
administration and improvement of the empire. Akbar showed toleration
alike to Christians, Muhammadans, and to all forms of the Hindu faith.
He had the Christian gospels and several Brahmanical treatises
translated into Persian. The result of his many conferences on religion
between learned men of all sects, are collected in the <i>Dabistan</i>.
Akbar was brought up as a Muhammadan, but became a Theist,
acknowledging one God, but rejecting all other dogmas. Died Sept.
1605.</p>
<p><b>Alberger</b> (John). American author of <i>Monks, Popes, and
their Political Intrigues</i> (Baltimore, 1871) and <i>Antiquity of
Christianity</i> (New York, 1874).</p>
<p><b>Albini</b> (Giuseppe). Italian physiologist, b. Milan. In 1845 he
studied medicine in Paris. He has written on embryology and many other
physiological subjects.</p>
<p><b>Alchindus.</b> <span class="sc">Yakub ibn Is&rsquo;hak ibn
Subbah</span> (Ab&uacute; Y&uacute;suf) called <i>Al Kindi</i>, Arab
physician and philosopher, the great grandson of one of the companions
of Muhammad, the prophet, flourished from 814 to about 840. He was a
rationalist in religion, and for his scientific studies he was set down
as a magician.</p>
<p><b>Alciati</b> (Giovanni Paolo). A Milanese of noble family. At
first a Romanist, he resigned that faith for Calvinism, but gradually
advanced to Anti-trinitarianism, which he defends in two letters to
Gregorio Pauli, dated Austerlitz 1564 and 1565. Beza says that Alciati
deserted the Christian faith and became a Muhammadan, but Bayle takes
pains to disprove this. Died at Dantzic about 1570.</p>
<p><b>Aleardi</b> (Gaetano). Italian poet, known as Aleardo Aleardi,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e488" href="#xd25e488" name=
"xd25e488">12</a>]</span>b. Verona, 4 Nov. 1812. He was engaged in a
life-long struggle against the Austrian dominion, and his patriotic
poems were much admired. In 1859 he was elected deputy to Parliament
for Brescia. Died Verona, 16 July, 1878.</p>
<p><b>Alembert</b> (Jean le Rond d&rsquo;), mathematician and
philosopher, b. at Paris 16 Nov. 1717. He was an illegitimate son of
Canon Destouches and Mme. Tencin, and received his Christian name from
a church near which he was exposed as a foundling. He afterwards
resided for forty years with his nurse, nor would he leave her for the
most tempting offers. In 1741, he was admitted a member of the Academy
of Sciences. In 1749, he obtained the prize medal from the Academy of
Berlin, for a discourse on the theory of winds. In 1749, he solved the
problem of the procession of the equinoxes and explained the mutation
of the earth&rsquo;s axis. He next engaged with Diderot, with whose
opinions he was in complete accord, in compiling the famous
<i>Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, for which he wrote the preliminary
discourse. In addition to this great work he published many historical,
philosophical and scientific essays, and largely corresponded with
Voltaire. His work on the Destruction of the Jesuits is a caustic and
far-reaching production. In a letter to Frederick the Great, he says:
&ldquo;As for the existence of a supreme intelligence, I think that
those who deny it advance more than they can prove, and scepticism is
the only reasonable course.&rdquo; He goes on to say, however, that
experience invincibly proves the materiality of the &ldquo;soul.&rdquo;
Died 29 Oct. 1783. In 1799 two volumes of his posthumous essays were
printed in Paris. His works prove d&rsquo;Alembert to have been of
broad spirit and of most extensive knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Alfieri</b> (Vittorio), Count. Famous Italian poet and dramatist,
b. Asti, Piedmont, 17 Jan. 1749, of a noble family. His tragedies are
justly celebrated, and in his <i>Essay on Tyranny</i> he shows himself
as favorable to religious as to political liberty. Written in his
youth, this work was revised at a more advanced age, the author
remarking that if he had no longer the courage, or rather the fire,
necessary to compose it, he nevertheless retained intelligence,
independence and judgment enough to approve it, and to let it stand as
the last of his literary productions. His attack is chiefly directed
against Catholicism, but he does not spare Christianity. &ldquo;Born
among a people,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e504" href=
"#xd25e504" name="xd25e504">13</a>]</span>he says, &ldquo;slavish,
ignorant, and already entirely subjugated by priests, the Christian
religion knows only how to enjoin the blindest obedience, and is
unacquainted even with the name of liberty.&rdquo; Alfieri&rsquo;s
tragedy of <i>Saul</i> has been prohibited on the English stage. Died
Florence, 8 Oct. 1803.</p>
<p><b>Alfonso X.</b>, surnamed the Wise, King of Castillo and of Leon;
b. in 1223, crowned 1252. A patron of science and lover of astronomy.
He compiled a complete digest of Roman, feudal and canon law, and had
drawn up the astronomical tables called Alfonsine Tables. By his
liberality and example he gave a great impulse to Spanish literature.
For his intercourse with Jews and Arabians, his independence towards
the Pope and his free disposal of the clerical revenues, he has been
stigmatised as an Atheist. To him is attributed the well-known remark
that had he been present at the creation of the world he would have
proposed some <span class="corr" id="xd25e513" title=
"Source: improvents">improvements</span>. Father Lenfant adds the pious
lie that &ldquo;The king had scarcely pronounced this blasphemy when a
thunderbolt fell and reduced his wife and two children to ashes.&rdquo;
Alfonso X. died 4 April, 1284.</p>
<p><b>Algarotti</b> (Francesco), Count. Italian writer and art critic,
b. at Venice, 11 Dec. 1712. A visit to England led him to write
<i>Newtonianism for the Ladies</i>. He afterwards visited Berlin and
became the friend both of Voltaire and of Frederick the Great, who
appointed him his Chamberlain. Died with philosophical composure at
Pisa, 3 May, 1764.</p>
<p><b>Alger</b> (William Rounseville), b. at Freetown, Massachusetts,
30 Dec. 1822, educated at Harvard, became a Unitarian preacher of the
advanced type. His <i>Critical History of the Doctrine of a Future
Life</i>, with a complete bibliography of the subject by Ezra Abbot, is
a standard work, written from the Universalist point of view.</p>
<p><b>Allen</b> (Charles Grant Blairfindie), naturalist and author, b.
in Kingston, Canada, 24 Feb. 1848. He studied at Merton College,
Oxford, and graduated with honors 1871. In 1873 appointed Professor of
Logic in Queen&rsquo;s College, Spanish town, Jamaica; from 1874 to
&rsquo;77 he was its principal. Since then he has resided in England,
and become known by his popular expositions of Darwinism. His published
works include <i>Physiological &AElig;sthetics</i> (1877), <i>The
Evolutionist at Large</i> (1881), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Studies</i> (1883), <i>Charles Darwin</i> (1885), and several novels.
Grant Allen has also edited the miscellaneous works of Buckle, and has
written on <i>Force and Energy</i> (1888).</p>

of the most active of the revolutionary heroes, he raised a company of
volunteers known as the &ldquo;Green Mountain Boys,&rdquo; and took by
surprise the British fortress of Ticonderoga, capturing 100 guns, 10
May, 1775. He was declared an outlaw and &pound;100 offered for his
arrest by Gov. Tryon of New York. Afterwards he was taken prisoner and
sent to England. At first treated with cruelty, he was eventually
exchanged for another officer, 6 May, 1778. He was a member of the
state legislature, and succeeded in obtaining the recognition of
Vermont as an independent state. He published in 1784 <i>Reason the
only Oracle of Man</i>, the first publication in the United States
openly directed against the Christian religion. It has been frequently
reprinted and is still popular in America. Died Burlington, Vermont, 13
Feb. 1789. A statue is erected to him at Montpelier, Vermont.</p>

and to have denied the permanent individuality of the soul. His
principal work is a sort of encyclop&aelig;dia. R&eacute;nan says he
expressly rejected all supernatural revelation. Died at Damascus Dec.
950, aged upwards of eighty.</p>
<p><b>Amaury</b> or <b>Amalric de Chartres</b>, a heretic of the

taught a kind of Pantheism, and that the reign of the Father and Son
must give place to that of the Holy Spirit. Ten of his disciples were
burnt at Paris 20 Dec. 1210, and the bones of Amaury were exhumed and
placed in the flames.</p>
<p id="amberley"><b>Amberley</b> (John <span class="sc">Russell</span>)
Viscount, eldest son of Earl Russell, b. 1843. Educated at Harrow,
Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge, where ill-health prevented
him reading for honors. He entered Parliament in 1866 as Radical member
for Nottingham. Lord Amberley contributed thoughtful articles to the
<i>North British</i>, the <i>Fortnightly</i> and <i>Theological
Reviews</i>, and will be remembered by his bold <i>Analysis of
Religious Belief</i> (1876), in which he examines, compares and
criticises the various faiths of the world. Lord Amberley left his son
to be brought up by Mr. Spalding, a self-taught man of great ability
and force of character; but the will was set aside, on appeal to the
Court of Chancery, in consideration of Mr. Spalding&rsquo;s heretical
views. Died 8 Jan. 1876.</p>

century, b. at Antioch. He wrote the Roman history from the reign of
Nerva to the death of Valens in thirty-one books, of which the first
thirteen are lost. His history is esteemed impartial and trustworthy.
He served under Julian, and compares the rancor of the Christians of
the period to that of wild beasts. Gibbon calls him &ldquo;an accurate
and faithful guide.&rdquo; Died about 395 <span class=

adopt that calling, was born of Christian parents in Alexandria during
the second century. He, however, turned Pagan and opened a school of
philosophy. Among his pupils were Origen, Longinus and Plotinus. He
undoubtedly originated the Neo-Platonic movement, which formed the most
serious opposition to Christianity in its early career. Ammonius died

<p id="annet"><b>Annet</b> (Peter). One of the most forcible writers
among the English Deists, b. at Liverpool in 1693. He was at one time a
schoolmaster and invented a system of shorthand. Priestley learnt it at
school and corresponded with Annet. In 1739 he published a pamphlet on
<i>Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion</i>, by P. A., minister of
religion. This was followed by <i>the Conception of Jesus as the
Foundation of the Christian Religion</i>, in which he boldly attacks
the doctrine of the Incarnation as &ldquo;a legend of the
Romanists,&rdquo; and <i>The Resurrection of Jesus Considered</i>
(1744) in answer to Bishop Sherlock&rsquo;s <i>Trial of the
Witnesses</i>. This controversy was continued in <i>The Resurrection
Reconsidered</i> and <i>The Resurrection Defenders Stript of all
Defence</i>. In <i>An Examination of the History and Character of St.
Paul</i> he attacks the sincerity of the apostle to the Gentiles and
even questions the authenticity of his epistles. In <i>Supernaturals
Examined</i> (1747) he argues that all miracles are incredible. In 1761
he issued nine numbers of the <i>Free Inquirer</i>, in which he
attacked the authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch. For this
he was brought before the King&rsquo;s Bench and sentenced to suffer
one month&rsquo;s imprisonment in Newgate, to stand twice in the
pillory, once at Charing Cross and once at the Exchange, with a label
&ldquo;For Blasphemy,&rdquo; then to have a year&rsquo;s hard labor in
Bridewell and to find sureties for good behavior during the rest of his
life. It is related that a woman seeing Annet in the pillory said,
&ldquo;Gracious! pilloried for blasphemy. Why, don&rsquo;t we blaspheme
every day!&rdquo; After his release Annet set up a school at Lambeth.
Being asked his views on a future life he replied by this apologue:
&ldquo;One of my friends in Italy, seeing the sign of an inn, asked if
that was the Angel.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;do
you not see it is the sign of a dragon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said
my friend, &ldquo;as I have never seen either angel or dragon, how can
I tell whether it is one or the other?&rdquo; Died 18 Jan. 1769. <i>The
History of the Man after God&rsquo;s Own Heart</i> (1761) ascribed to
Annet, was more probably written by Archibald Campbell. <i>The View of
the Life of King David</i> (1765) by W. Skilton, Horologist, is also
falsely attributed to Annet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e736"

rejection of supernaturalism, occasioned much stir and was followed by
<i>God and the Bible</i>. In 1877 Mr. Arnold published <i>Last Essays

the thought of his age, but he curiously unites rejection of
supernaturalism, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e884" href=

their obstinacy, and it is pretended many were put to death in the
reign of one of the best emperors that ever ruled. If so we may be
assured it was for their crimes. Ecclesiastical historians have
invented another pious miracle in a victory gained through the prayers
of the Christians. Antoninus held that duty was indispensable even were
there no gods. His <i>Meditations</i>, written in the midst of a most

Berlin, in 1834 he received a professorship of theology. He first
attained celebrity by a review of the <i>Life of Jesus</i> by Strauss
(1835). This was followed by his <i>Journal of Speculative Theology</i>
and <i>Critical Exposition of the Religion of the Old Testament</i>. He
then proceeded to a <i>Review of the Gospel History</i>, upon the
publication of which (1840) he was deprived of his professorship at
Bonn. To this followed <i>Christianity Unveiled</i> (1843), which was
destroyed at Zurich before its publication. This work continued his
opposition to religion, which was carried still further in ironical
style in his <i>Proclamation of the Day of Judgement concerning Hegel
the Atheist</i>. Bauer&rsquo;s heresy deepened with age, and in his
<i>Review of the Gospels and History of their Origin</i> (1850), to
which <i>Apostolical History</i> is a supplement, he attacked the
historical truth of the New Testament narratives. In his <i>Review of
the Epistles attributed to St. Paul</i> (1852) he tries to show that
the first four epistles, which had hardly ever before been questioned,
were not written by Paul, but are the production of the second century.
In his <i>Christ and the C&aelig;sars</i> he shows the influence of
Seneca and Greco-Roman thought upon early Christianity. He died near

Church history. Baur is the author of numerous works on dogmatic and
historic theology, in which he subverts all the fundamental positions
of Christianity. He was an Hegelian Pantheist. Among his more important
works are <i>Christianity and the Church in the First Three
Centuries</i> and <i>Paul: His Life and Works</i>. These are translated
into English. He acknowledges only four of the epistles of Paul and the
Revelation as genuine products of the apostolic age, and shows how very
far from simplicity were the times and doctrines of primitive
Christianity. After a life of great literary activity he died at
T&uuml;bingen, 2 Dec. 1860.</p>

to Switzerland, becoming a sceptic, as is evident from <i>Thoughts on
the Comet</i>, in which he compares the supposed mischiefs of Atheism
with those of fanaticism, and from many articles in his famous <i lang=
"fr">Dictionnaire Critique</i>, a work still of value for its curious
learning and shrewd observation. In his journal <i lang="fr">Nouvelles
de la R&eacute;publique des Lettres</i> he advocates religious
toleration on the ground of the difficulty of distinguishing truth from
error. His criticism of Maimbourg&rsquo;s <i>History of Calvinism</i>
was ordered to be burnt by the hangman. Jurieu persecuted him, and he
was ordered to be more careful in preparing the second edition of his
dictionary. He died <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1617" href=

<p><b>Beethoven</b> (Ludwig van), one of the greatest of musical
composers, b. Bonn 16 Dec. 1770. His genius early displayed itself, and
at the age of five he was set to study the works of Handel and Bach.
His many compositions are the glory of music. They include an opera
&ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; two masses, oratorios, symphonies, concertos,
overtures and sonatas, and are characterised by penetrating power, rich
imagination, intense passion, and tenderness. When about the age of
forty he became totally deaf, but continued to compose till his death
at Vienna, 26 March, 1827. He regarded Goethe with much the same esteem
as Wagner showed for Schopenhauer, but he disliked his courtliness. His
Republican sentiments are well known, and Sir George Macfarren, in his
life in the <i>Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography</i>, speaks
of him as a &ldquo;Freethinker,&rdquo; and says the remarkable mass in
C. &ldquo;might scarcely have proceeded from an entirely orthodox
thinker.&rdquo; Sir George Grove, in his <i>Dictionary of Music and
Musicians</i>, says: &ldquo;Formal religion he apparently had
none,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Bible does not appear to have been one of
his favorite books.&rdquo; At the end of his arrangement of
&ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; Moscheles had written, &ldquo;Fine. With

January, 1876 became a weekly, and has since become one of the
principal Freethought organs in America. In 1879 he was sentenced to
thirteen months&rsquo; imprisonment for sending through the post a
pamphlet by Ezra H. Heywood on the marriage question. A tract, entitled
<i>An Open Letter to Jesus Christ</i>, was read in court to bias the

named Woodward was the publisher of Tindal&rsquo;s <i>Christianity as
Old as the Creation</i>. Was educated at Westminster and Oxford, where
he graduated M.A. 1767. Bentham is justly regarded as the father of the
school of philosophical Radicalism. In philosophy he is the great
teacher of Utilitarianism; as a jurist he did much to disclose the
defects of and improve our system of law. Macaulay says he &ldquo;found
jurisprudence a gibberish and left it a science.&rdquo; His most
pronounced Freethought work was that written in conjunction with Grote,
published as <i>An Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion</i>,
by Philip Beauchamp, 1822. Among his numerous other works we can only
mention <i>Deontology, or the Science of Mortality</i>, an exposition
of utilitarianism; <i>Church of Englandism and its Catechism Examined;
Not Paul, but Jesus</i>, published under the pseudonym of Gamaliel
Smith. Died 6 June, 1832, leaving his body for the purposes of

<p><b>Besant</b> (Annie) n&eacute;e Wood. B. London, 1 Oct. 1847.
Educated in Evangelicalism by Miss Marryat, sister of novelist, but
turned to the High Church by reading Pusey and others. In &ldquo;Holy
Week&rdquo; of 1866 she resolved to write the story of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1957" href="#xd25e1957" name=
"xd25e1957">41</a>]</span>week from the gospel. Their contradictions
startled her but she regarded her doubts as sin. In Dec. &rsquo;67 she
married the Rev. F. Besant, and read and wrote extensively. The torment
a child underwent in whooping-cough caused doubts as to the goodness of
God. A study of Greg&rsquo;s <i>Creed of Christendom</i> and
Arnold&rsquo;s <i>Literature and Dogma</i> increased her scepticism.
She became acquainted with the Rev. C. Voysey and Thomas Scott, for
whom she wrote an <i>Essay on the Deity of Jesus of Nazareth</i>,
&ldquo;by the wife of a beneficed clergyman.&rdquo; This led to her
husband insisting on her taking communion or leaving. She chose the
latter course, taking by agreement her daughter with her. Thrown on her
own resources, she wrote further tracts for Mr. Scott, reprinted in
<i>My Path to Atheism</i> (&rsquo;77). Joined the National Secular
Society, and in &rsquo;74 wrote in the <i>National Reformer</i> over
the signature of &ldquo;Ajax.&rdquo; Next year she took to the platform
and being naturally eloquent soon won her way to the front rank as a
Freethought lecturess, and became joint editor of the <i>National
Reformer</i>. Some lectures on the French Revolution were republished
in book form. In April, &rsquo;77, she was arrested with Mr. Bradlaugh
for publishing the <i>Fruits of Philosophy</i>. After a brilliant
defence, the jury exonerated the defendants from any corrupt motives,
and although they were sentenced the indictment was quashed in Feb.
&rsquo;78, and the case was not renewed. In May, &rsquo;78, a petition
in Chancery was presented to deprive Mrs. Besant of her child on the
ground of her Atheistic and Malthusian views. Sir G. Jessell granted
the petition. In &rsquo;80 Mrs. Besant matriculated at the London
University and took 1st B.Sc. with honors in &rsquo;82. She has debated
much and issued many pamphlets to be found in <i>Theological Essays and
Debates</i>. She wrote the second part of the <i>Freethinkers&rsquo;
Text Book</i> dealing with Christian evidence; has written on the
<i>Sins of the Church</i>, 1886, and the <i>Evolution of Society</i>.
She has translated Jules Soury&rsquo;s <i>Religion of Israel</i>, and
<i>Jesus of the Gospels</i>; Dr. L. B&uuml;chner on the <i>Influence of
Heredity</i> and <i>Mind in Animals</i>, and from the fifteenth edition
of <i>Force and Matter</i>. From &rsquo;83 to &rsquo;88 she edited

publication was attacked in 1821. Boyle gave no name, and was indicted
and tried as &ldquo;a man with name unknown&rdquo; for publishing a
blasphemous and seditious libel. In his defence he ably asserted his
right to hold and publish his opinions. He read portions of the Bible
in court to prove he was justified in calling it obscene. Upon being
sentenced, 27 May, 1822, to eighteen months&rsquo; imprisonment and to
find sureties for five years, he remarked &ldquo;I have a mind, my

Packer, and found refuge with the widow of R. Carlile. In Dec. 1850 he
entered the Dragoon Guards and proceeded to Dublin. Here he met James
Thomson, the poet, and contracted a friendship which lasted for many
years. He got his discharge, and in &rsquo;53 returned to London and
became a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk. He began to write and lecture under
the <i>nom de guerre</i> of &ldquo;Iconoclast,&rdquo; edited the
<i>Investigator</i>, &rsquo;59; and had numerous debates with ministers

which in &rsquo;68&ndash;9 he successfully defended against a
prosecution of the Attorney General, who wished securities against
blasphemy. In &rsquo;68 he began his efforts to enter Parliament, and
in 1880 was returned for Northampton. After a long struggle with the
House, which would not admit the Atheist, he at length took his seat in
1885. He was four times re-elected, and the litigation into which he
was plunged will become as historic as that of John Wilkes. Prosecuted
in &rsquo;76 for publishing <i>The Fruits of Philosophy</i>, he
succeeded in quashing the indictment. Mr. Bradlaugh has had numerous
debates, several of which are published. He has also written many
pamphlets, of which we mention <i>New Lives of Abraham, David, and
other saints</i>, <i>Who was Jesus Christ?</i> <i>What did Jesus
Teach?</i> <i>Has Man a Soul, Is there a God?</i> etc. His <i>Plea for

commenced a commentary on the Bible, entitled <i>The Bible, What is
it?</i> In 1865 this appeared in enlarged form, dealing only with the
Pentateuch. In 1882 he published <i>Genesis, Its Authorship and
Authenticity</i>. In Parliament Mr. Bradlaugh has become a conspicuous
figure, and has introduced many important measures. In 1888 he
succeeded in passing an Oaths Bill, making affirmations permissible
instead of oaths. His elder daughter, Alice, b. 30 April, 1856, has
written on <i>Mind Considered as a Bodily Function</i>, 1884. Died 2

Miss Hennell, sister of C. C. Hennell, and took the <i>System of
Nature</i> and Volney&rsquo;s <i>Ruins of Empires</i> &ldquo;to enliven
the honeymoon.&rdquo; Among his friends was Mary Ann Evans
(&ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo;), who accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Bray to
Italy. His works on <i>The Philosophy of Necessity</i> (1841) and
<i>Cerebral Psychology</i> (1875) give the key to all his thought. He
wrote a number of Thomas Scott&rsquo;s series of tracts: <i>Illusion
and Delusion</i>, <i>The Reign of Law in Mind as in Matter</i>,
<i>Toleration</i> with remarks on Professor Tyndall&rsquo;s

<p><b>Buchanan</b> (George), Scotch historian and scholar, b. Killearn,
Feb. 1506. Evincing an early love of study, he was sent to Paris at the
age of fourteen. He returned to Scotland and became distinguished for
his learning. James V. appointed him tutor to his natural son. He
composed his <i>Franciscanus et Fratres</i>, a satire on the monks,
which hastened the Scottish reformation. This exposed him to the
vengeance of the clergy. Not content with calling him Atheist,
Archbishop Beaton had him arrested and confined in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Castle, from whence he escaped and fled to England. Here he found, as
he said, Henry VIII. burning men of opposite opinions at the same stake
for religion. He returned to Paris, but was again subjected to the
persecution of Beaton, the Scottish Ambassador. On the death of a
patron at Bordeaux, in 1548, he was seized by the Inquisition and
immured for a year and a half in a monastery, where he translated the
Psalms into Latin. He eventually returned to Scotland, where he
espoused the party of Moray. After a most active life, he died 28 Sept.
1582, leaving a History of Scotland, besides numerous poems, satires,
and political writings, the most important of which is a work of
republican tendency, <i>De Jure Regni</i>, the <i>Rights of
Kings</i>.</p>
<p><b>Buchanan</b> (Robert), Socialist, b. Ayr, 1813. He was
successively a schoolmaster, a Socialist missionary and a journalist.
He settled in Manchester, where he published works on the <i>Religion
of The Past and Present</i>, 1839; the <i>Origin and Nature of
Ghosts</i>, 1840. An Exposure of Joseph Barker, and a <i>Concise
History of Modern Priestcraft</i> also bear the latter date. At this
time the Socialists were prosecuted for lecturing on Sunday, and
Buchanan was fined for refusing to take the oath of supremacy, etc.
After the decline of Owenism, he wrote for the <span class=

<p><b>Buckle</b> (Henry Thomas), philosophical historian, b. Lee, Kent,
24 Nov. 1821. In consequence of his delicate health he was educated at
home. His mother was a strict Calvinist, his father a strong Tory, but
a visit to the Continent made him a Freethinker and Radical. He ever
afterwards held travelling to be the best education. It was his
ambition to write a <i>History of Civilisation in England</i>, but so
vast was his design that his three notable volumes with that title form
only part of the introduction. The first appeared in 1858, and created
a great sensation by its boldness. In the following year he championed
the cause of Pooley, who was condemned for blasphemy, and dared the
prosecution of infidels of standing. In 1861 he visited the East, in
the hope of improving his health, but died at Damascus, 29 May, 1862.
Much of the material collected for his History has been published in
his <i>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</i>, edited by Helen Taylor,
1872. An abridged edition, edited by Grant Allen, appeared in 1886.</p>

numerous editions and been translated into nearly all the European
languages. This work lost him the place of professor which he held at

capacity for making science attractive. Buffon lived much in seclusion,
and attached himself to no sect or religion. Some of his sentences were
attacked by the Sorbonne. H&eacute;rault de S&ecirc;chelles says that
Buffon said: &ldquo;I have named the Creator, but it is only necessary

principal work is entitled <i>Materials for Thinking</i>. Colton
largely availed himself of this work in his <i>Lacon</i>. It went
through five editions in his lifetime, and portions were reprinted in

appeared in Latin, and was translated and modified in 1684. In 1692
Burnet published, both in English and in Latin, his <i lang=

Doctrine of the Origin of Things. He professes in this to reconcile his
theory with Genesis, which receives a figurative interpretation; and a
ludicrous dialogue between Eve and the serpent gave great offence. In a

His work on the <i>Origin and Progress of Language</i> (published
anonymously 1773&ndash;92), excited much derision by his studying man
as one of the animals and collecting facts about savage tribes to throw
light on civilisation. He first maintained that the orang-outang was
allied to the human species. He also wrote on <i>Ancient

acquired reputation as an intrepid explorer. In &rsquo;51 he returned
to England and started for Mecca and Medina, visiting those shrines
unsuspected, as a Moslem pilgrim. He was chief of the staff of the
Osmanli cavalry in the Crimean war, and has made many remarkable and
dangerous expeditions in unknown lands; he discovered and opened the
lake regions in Central Africa and explored the highlands of Brazil. He
has been consul at Fernando Po, Santos, Damascus, and since 1872 at
Trieste, and speaks over thirty languages. His latest work is a new
translation of <i>The Thousand Nights and a Night</i> in 10 vols. Being

awoke one morning to find himself famous. His power was, however, first
shown in his <i>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>, in which he
satirised his critics, 1809. He then travelled on the Continent, the
result of which was seen in his <i>Childe Harold&rsquo;s Pilgrimage</i>
and other works. He married 2 Jan. 1815, but a separation took place in
the following year. Lord Byron then resided in Italy, where he made the
acquaintance of Shelley. In 1823 he devoted his name and fortune to the
cause of the Greek revolution, but was seized with fever and died at
Missolonghi, 19 April, 1824. His drama of <i>Cain: a Mystery</i>, 1822,
is his most serious utterance, and it shows a profound contempt for
religious dogma. This feeling is also exhibited in his magnificent
burlesque poem, <i>The Vision of Judgment</i>, which places him at the
head of English satirists. In his letters to the Rev. Francis Hodgson,
1811, he distinctly says: &ldquo;I do not believe in any revealed
religion&#8202;&hellip;. I will have nothing to do with your

Venice, and Padua. At Bologna some of his MS. fell into the hands of
the Inquisition, and he was arrested. He ably defended himself and was
acquitted. Returning to Calabria in 1599, he was arrested on charges of
heresy and conspiracy against the Spanish Government of Naples, and
having appealed to Rome, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in the

history of the Spanish monarchy, and several philosophical works. On 15
May, 1626, he was released by the intervention of Pope Urban VIII. He
was obliged to fly from Rome to France, where he met Gassendi. He also
visited Descartes in Holland. Julian Hibbert remarked that his <i lang=

&rsquo;66&ndash;&rsquo;70, and on the <i>Theory of Evolution</i>,

<p><b>Cardano</b> (Girolamo), better known as <span class="sc">Jerome
Cardan</span>, Italian mathematician, and physician, b. Pavia, 24 Sept.
1501. He studied medicine, but was excluded from the Milan College of
Physicians on account of illegitimate birth. He and his young wife were
at one time compelled to take refuge in the workhouse. It is not
strange that his first work was an exposure of the fallacies of the
faculty. A fortunate cure brought him into notice and he journeyed to
Scotland as the medical adviser of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, 1551.
In 1563 he was arrested at Bologna for heresy, but was released,
although deprived of his professorship. He died at Rome, 20 Sept. 1576,
having, it is said, starved himself to verify his own prediction of his
death. Despite some superstition, Cardano did much to forward science,
especially by his work on Algebra, and in his works <i lang="la">De
Subtilitate Rerum</i> and <i lang="la">De Varietate Rerum</i>, amid
much that is fanciful, perceived the universality of natural law and
the progressive evolution of life. Scaliger accused him of Atheism.
P&uuml;njer says &ldquo;Cardanus deserves to be named along with
Telesius as one of the principal founders of Natural
Philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Carducci</b> (Giosu&egrave;), Italian poet and Professor of
Italian Literature at the University of Bologna, b. Pietrasantra, in

all kings! Long live the republic! Sprung into fame by his <i>Hymn to
Satan</i>, &rsquo;69, by which he intended the spirit of resistance. He
has written many poems and satires in which he exhibits himself an
ardent Freethinker and Republican. At the end of &rsquo;57 he wrote his
famous verse &ldquo;Il secoletto vil che
cristianeggia&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This vile christianising
century.&rdquo; In &rsquo;60 he became professor of Greek in Bologna
University, being suspended for a short while in &rsquo;67 for an
address to Mazzini. In &rsquo;76 he was elected as republican

1831, delivered discourses at the Rotunda, and started a journal, the
<i>Isis</i>, which lasted from 11 Feb. to 15 Dec. 1832. The <i>Isis</i>
was dedicated to the young women of England &ldquo;until superstition
is extinct,&rdquo; and contained Frances Wright&rsquo;s discourses, in
addition to those by Mrs. Carlile, who survived till &rsquo;61. Mr.
Bradlaugh lodged with Mrs. Carlile at the Warner Place Institute, in
1849. She had three children, Hypatia, Theophila and Julian, of whom
the second is still living.</p>
<p><b>Carlile</b> (Jane), first wife of R. Carlile, who carried on his

apprenticed to a tin-plate worker, and followed that business till he
was twenty-six, when, having read the works of Paine, he began selling
works like Wooler&rsquo;s <i>Black Dwarf</i>, which Government
endeavored to suppress. Sherwin offered him the dangerous post of
publisher of the <i>Republican</i>, which he accepted. He then
published Southey&rsquo;s <i>Wat Tyler</i>, reprinted the political
works of Paine and the parodies for which Hone was tried, but which
cost Carlile eighteen weeks&rsquo; imprisonment. In 1818 he published
Paine&rsquo;s Theological Works. The prosecution instituted induced him
to go on printing similar works, such as Palmer&rsquo;s <i>Principles
of Nature</i>, <i>Watson Refuted</i>, <i>Jehovah Unveiled</i>, etc. By
Oct. 1819, he had six indictments to answer, on two of which he was
tried from 12 to 16 October. He read the whole of the <i>Age of
Reason</i> in his defence, in order to have it in the report of the
trial. He was found guilty and sentenced (16 Nov.) to fifteen hundred
pounds fine and three years&rsquo; imprisonment in Dorchester Gaol.
During his imprisonment his business was kept on by a succession of
shopmen. Refusing to find securities not to publish, he was kept in
prison till 18 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3420" href=

liberated unconditionally. During his imprisonment he edited the
<i>Republican</i>, which extended to fourteen volumes. He also edited
the <i>Deist</i>, the <i>Moralist</i>, the <i>Lion</i> (four volumes),
the <i>Prompter</i> (for No. 3 of which he again suffered thirty-two
months&rsquo; imprisonment), and the <i>Gauntlet</i>. Amongst his
writings are <i>An Address to Men of Science</i>, <i>The Gospel
according to R. Carlile</i>, <i>What is God?</i> <i>Every Woman&rsquo;s

University of Edinburgh. He, however, became a tutor, and occupied his
leisure in translating from the German. He married Jane Welsh 17 Oct.
1826, and wrote in the <i>London Magazine</i> and <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> many masterly critical articles, notably on Voltaire,
Diderot, Burns, and German literature. In 1833&ndash;4 his <i lang=

&rsquo;34 he removed to London and began writing the <i>French
Revolution</i>, the MS. of the first vol. of which he confided to Mill,
with whom it was accidentally burnt. He re-wrote the work without
complaint, and it was published in &rsquo;37. He then delivered a
course of lectures on &ldquo;German Literature&rdquo; and on
&ldquo;Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History,&rdquo; in which
he treats Mahomet as the prophet &ldquo;we are freest to speak
of.&rdquo; His <i>Past and Present</i> was published in &rsquo;43. In
&rsquo;45 appeared <i>Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s Letters and Speeches</i>.
In &rsquo;50 he published <i>Latter-Day Pamphlets</i>, which contains
his most distinctive political and social doctrines, and in the
following year his <i>Life of John Sterling</i>, in which his heresy
clearly appears. His largest work is his <i>History of the Life and
Times of Frederick the Great</i>, in 10 vols. He was elected rector of
Edinburgh University in &rsquo;65. Died 5 Feb. 1881. Mr. Froude, in his
<i>Biography of Carlyle</i>, says, &ldquo;We have seen him confessing
to Irving that he did not believe as his friend did in the Christian
religion.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;the special miraculous occurrences of

<p id="carneades"><b>Carneades</b>, sceptical philosopher, b. Cyrene
about B.C. 213. He went early to Athens, and attended the lectures of
the Stoics, learning logic from Diogenes. In the year 155, he was
chosen with other deputies to go to Rome to deprecate a fine which had
been placed on the Athenians. During his stay at Rome he attracted
great attention by his philosophical orations. Carneades attacked the
very idea of a God at once infinite and an individual. He denied
providence and design. Many of his arguments are preserved in
Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Academics</i> and <i>De Natura Deorum</i>. Carneades
left no written works; his views seem to have been systematised by his
follower Clitomachus. He died <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 129.

Laney, Bishop of Ely, was dining in Charterhouse and remarked, not
knowing the author, &ldquo;&rsquo;twas no matter if all the copies were
burnt and the author with them, because it made every man&rsquo;s
private fancy judge of religion.&rdquo; Clifford died 10 Dec. 1677. In

published the <i>The Certainty of the Proofs of Mohammedanism</i>,
under the pseudonym of Ali-gier-ber, an anagram of Bergier, whose
<i>Certainty of the Proofs of Christianity</i> he parodies. He
travelled widely, but became a resident of Paris and a warm partisan of
the Revolution, to which he devoted his large fortune. He wrote a reply
to Burke, and continually wrote and spoke in favor of a Universal
Republic. On 19 June, 1790, he, at the head of men of all countries,
asked a place at the feast of Federation, and henceforward was styled
&ldquo;orator of the human race.&rdquo; He was, with Paine, Priestley,
Washington and Klopstock, made a French citizen, and in 1792 was
elected to the Convention by two departments. He debaptised himself,
taking the name Anacharsis, was a prime mover in the Anti-Catholic
party, and induced Bishop Gobel to resign. He declared there was no
other God but Nature. Incurring the enmity of Robespierre, he and Paine
were arrested as foreigners. After two and a half months&rsquo;
imprisonment at St. Lazare, he was brought to the scaffold with the
H&eacute;bertistes, 24 March, 1794. He died calmly, uttering
materialist sentiments to the last.</p>

regard its dogmas as imperfect and untenable.&rdquo; In &rsquo;48 he
visited Paris, and the same year produced his <i>Bothie of
Toper-na-Fuosich</i>: a Long-Vacation Pastoral. Between &rsquo;49 and

<p><b>Collins</b> (Anthony), English Deist, b. Heston, Middlesex, 21
June, 1676. He studied at Cambridge and afterwards at the Temple, and
became Justice of the Peace and Treasurer of the County of Essex. He
was an intimate friend of Locke, who highly esteemed him and made him
his executor. He wrote an <i>Essay on Reason</i>, 1707; <i>Priestcraft
in Perfection</i>, 1710; a <i>Vindication of the Divine Attributes</i>,
and a <i>Discourse on Freethinking</i>, 1713. This last occasioned a
great outcry, as it argued that all belief must be based on free
inquiry, and that the use of reason would involve the abandonment of
supernatural revelation. In 1719 he published <i>An Inquiry Concerning
Human Liberty</i>, a brief, pithy defence of necessitarianism, and in
1729 <i>A Discourse on Liberty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e4313"

Christian Religion</i>, and this was followed by <i>The Scheme of
Literal Prophecy Considered</i>, 1726. He was a skilful disputant, and
wrote with great ability. He is also credited with <i>A Discourse
Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</i>. Died at London, 13 Dec.
1729. Collins, says Mr. Leslie Stephen, &ldquo;appears to have been an
amiable and upright man, and to have made all readers welcome to the
use of a free library.&rdquo; Professor Fraser calls him &ldquo;a
remarkable man,&rdquo; praises his &ldquo;love of truth and moral
courage,&rdquo; and allows that in answering Dr. Samuel Clarke on the
question of liberty and necessity he &ldquo;states the arguments
against human freedom with a logical force unsurpassed by any
necessitarian.&rdquo; A similar testimony to Collins as a thinker and
dialectician is borne by Professor Huxley.</p>

special providence and efficacy of prayer. In &rsquo;33 he married a
daughter of Mrs. Siddons. He visited the United States and lectured on
Moral Philosophy and Secular Education. His last work was <i>The
Relations between Science and Religion</i>, &rsquo;57, in which he
continued to uphold Secular Theism. He also published many lectures and

<p><b>Comte</b> (Isidore Auguste Marie Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier), French
philosopher, mathematician and reformer, b. at Montpelier, 12 Jan.
1798. Educated at Paris in the Polytechnic School, where he
distinguished himself by his mathematical talent. In 1817 he made the
acquaintance of St. Simon, agreeing with him as to the necessity of a
Social renovation based upon a mental revolution. On the death of St.
Simon (&rsquo;25) Comte devoted himself to the elaboration of an
original system of scientific thought, which, in the opinion of some
able judges, entitles him to be called the Bacon of the nineteenth
century. Mill speaks of him as the superior of Descartes and Leibniz.
In &rsquo;25 he married, but the union proved unhappy. In the following
year he lectured, but broke down under an attack of brain fever, which
occasioned his detention in an asylum. He speedily recovered, and in
&rsquo;28 resumed his lectures, which were attended by men like
Humboldt, Ducrotay, Broussais, Carnot, etc. In &rsquo;30 he put forward
the first volumes of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e4400" href=
"#xd25e4400" name="xd25e4400">86</a>]</span><i>Course of Positive
Philosophy</i>, which in &rsquo;42 was completed by the publication of
the sixth volume. A condensed English version of this work was made by
Harriet Martineau, &rsquo;53. In &rsquo;45 Comte formed a passionate
Platonic attachement to Mme. Clotilde de Vaux, who died in the
following year, having profoundely influenced Comte&rsquo;s life. In
consequence of his opinions, he lost his professorship, and was
supported by his disciples&mdash;Mill, Molesworth and Grote, in
England, assisting. Among other works, Comte published <i>A General
View of Positivism</i>, &rsquo;48, translated by Dr. Bridges,
&rsquo;65; <i>A System of Positive Polity</i>, &rsquo;51, translated by
Drs. Bridges, Beesley, F. Harrison, etc., &rsquo;75&ndash;79; and <i>A
Positive Catechism</i>, &rsquo;54, translated by Dr. Congreve,
&rsquo;58. He also wrote on Positive Logic, which he intended to follow
with Positive Morality and Positive Industrialism. Comte was a profound
and suggestive thinker. He resolutely sets aside all theology and
metaphysics, coordinates the sciences and substitutes the service of
man for the worship of God. Mr. J. Cotter Morison says &ldquo;He
belonged to that small class of rare minds, whose errors are often more
valuable and stimulating than other men&rsquo;s truths.&rdquo; He died
of cancer in the stomach at Paris, 5 Sept. 1857.</p>
<p id="condillac"><b>Condillac</b> (Etienne <span class="sc">Bonnot

the principal being <i>A Treatise on the Sensations</i>, 1764; <i>A
Treatise on Animals</i>, and <i>An Essay on the Origin of Human

to a Jesuit&rsquo;s school, he soon gave up religion. At sixteen he
maintained a mathematical thesis in the presence of Alembert. In the
next year he dedicated to Turgot a <i>Profession of Faith</i>. After
some mathematical works, he was made member of the Academy, of which he
was appointed perpetual secretary, 1773. In 1776 he published his
atheistic <i>Letters of a Theologian</i>. He also wrote biographies of
Turgot and Voltaire, and in favor of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

independence and against negro slavery. In 1791 he represented Paris in
the National Assembly, of which he became Secretary. It was on his
motion that, in the following year, all orders of nobility were
abolished. Voting against the death of the king and siding with the
Gironde drew on him the vengeance of the extreme party. He took shelter

the controversy raised by the theologians, but followed his work with

Plants</i>, the <i>Forms of Flowers</i>, and <i>Earthworms</i>. He died

expressed unbelief in revelation. To a German student he wrote, in
&rsquo;79, &ldquo;Science has nothing to do with Christ, except in so
far as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in
admitting evidence. For myself I do not believe that there ever has
been any revelation.&rdquo; In his <i>Life and Letters</i> he relates
that between 1836 and 1842 he had come to see &ldquo;that the Old
Testament was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the
Hindoos.&rdquo; He rejected design and said &ldquo;I for one must be
content to remain an Agnostic.&rdquo;</p>

fellow-student <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e5572" href=
"#xd25e5572" name="xd25e5572">107</a>]</span>of Robespierre at Paris,
and became an advocate and an enthusiastic reformer. In July &rsquo;89
he incited the people to the siege of the Bastille, and thus began the
Revolution. On 29 Dec. 1790 he married Lucile Laridon-Duplessis. He
edited <i>Le Vieux Cordelier</i> and the <i lang=
"fr">R&eacute;volutions de France et de Brabant</i>, in which he stated
that Mohammedanism was as credible as Christianity. He was a Deist,
preferring Paganism to Christianity. Both creeds were more or less
unreasonable; but, folly for folly, he said, I prefer Hercules slaying
the Erymanthean boar to Jesus of Nazareth drowning two thousand pigs.
He was executed with Danton, 5 April 1794. His amiable wife, Lucile,
who was an Atheist (b. 1770), in a few days shared his fate (April 13).
Carlyle calls Desmoulins a man of genius, &ldquo;a fellow of infinite
shrewdness, wit&mdash;nay, humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="desperiers"><b>Des Periers</b> (Jean Bonaventure), French poet

His works are not extant, but several anecdotes are related of him, as
that he threw a wooden statue of Hercules into the fire to cook a dish
of lentils, saying the god had a thirteenth task to perform; and that,
being on his flight by sea overtaken by a storm, hearing his
fellow-passengers say it was because an Atheist was on board, he
pointed to other vessels struggling in the same storm without being

<p><b>Diderot</b> (Denis), French philosopher, b. Langres, 6 Oct. 1713.
His father, a cutler, intended him for the Church. Educated by Jesuits,
at the age of twelve he received the tonsure. He had a passion for
books, but, instead of becoming a Jesuit, went to Paris, where he
supported himself by teaching and translating. In 1746 he published
<i>Philosophic Thoughts</i>, which was condemned to be burnt. It did
much to advance freedom of opinion. Three years later his <i>Letters on
the Blind</i> occasioned his imprisonment at Vincennes for its
materialistic Atheism. Rousseau, who called him &ldquo;a transcendent
genius,&rdquo; visited Diderot in prison, where he remained three
years. Diderot projected the famous <i lang=
"fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, which he edited with Alembert, and he
contributed some of the most important articles. With very inadequate
recompense, and amidst difficulties that would have appalled an
ordinary editor, Diderot superintended the undertaking for many years
(1751&ndash;65). He also contributed to other important works, such as
Raynal&rsquo;s <i>Philosophic History</i>, <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Esprit</i>, by Helvetius, and <i>The System of Nature</i>
and other works of his friend D&rsquo;Holbach. Diderot&rsquo;s fertile

century.&rdquo;</p>

<i>Christianity not Founded on Argument</i>, which in a tone of grave
irony contends that Christianity can only be accepted by faith. He was
brought up to the law and was a zealous friend of the Society for the

<p><b>Dolet</b> (Etienne), a learned French humanist, b. Orleans 3 Aug.
1509. He studied in Paris, Padua and Venice. For his heresy he had to
fly from Toulouse and lived for some time at Lyons, where he
established a printing-press and published some of his works, for which
he was imprisoned. He was acquainted with Rabelais, Des Periers, and
other advanced men of the time. In 1543 the Parliament condemned his
books to be burnt, and in the next year he was arrested on a charge of
Atheism. After being kept two years in prison he was strangled and
burnt, 3 Aug. 1546. It is related that seeing the sorrow of the crowd,
he said: &ldquo;Non dolet ipe Dolet, sed pia turba
dolet.&rdquo;&mdash;Dolet grieves not, but the generous crowd grieves.
His goods being confiscated, his widow and children were left to
beggary. &ldquo;The French language,&rdquo; says A. F. Didot,
&ldquo;owes him much for his treatises, translations, and
poesies.&rdquo; Dolet&rsquo;s biographer, M. Joseph Boulmier, calls him
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">le Christ de la pens&eacute;e

<p id="eliot">&ldquo;<b>Eliot</b> (George),&rdquo; the pen-name of Mary
Ann Lewes (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans) one of the greatest novelists of
the century, b. at Arbury Farm, near Griff, Warwickshire, 22 Nov. 1819.
In &rsquo;41 the family removed to Foleshill, near Coventry. Here she
made the friendship of the household of Charles Bray, and changed her
views from Evangelical Christianity to philosophical scepticism.
Influenced by <i>The Inquiry into the Origin of Christianity</i>, by C.
C. Hennell (Bray&rsquo;s brother-in-law), she made an analysis of that
work. Her first literary venture was translating Strauss&rsquo;
<i lang="de">Leben Jesu</i>, published in 1846. After the death of her
father (&rsquo;49) she travelled with the Brays upon the Continent, and
upon her return assisted Dr. Chapman in the editorship of the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, to which she contributed several articles.
She translated Feuerbach&rsquo;s <i>Essence of Christianity</i>,
&rsquo;54, the only work published with her real name, and also
translated from Spinoza&rsquo;s Ethics. Introduced by Herbert Spencer
to George Henry Lewes, she linked her life with his in defiance of the
conventions of society, July, &rsquo;54. Both were poor, but by his
advice she turned to fiction, in which she soon achieved success. Her
<i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, <i>Adam Bede</i>, <i>Mill on the
Floss</i>, <i>Silas Marner</i>, <i>Romola</i>, <i>Felix Holt</i>,
<i>Middlemarch</i>, <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, and <i>Theophrastus Such</i>
have become classics. As a poet, &ldquo;George Eliot&rdquo; does not
rank so high, but her little piece, &ldquo;Oh, may I join the choir
invisible,&rdquo; well expresses the emotion of the Religion of
Humanity, and her <i>Spanish Gipsy</i> she allowed was &ldquo;a mass of
Positivism.&rdquo; Lewes died in 1878, and within two years she married
his friend, J. W. Cross. Her new happiness was short-lived. She died 22
Dec. 1880, and is buried with Lewes at Highgate.</p>

visiting Carlyle. On his return he settled at Concord, giving
occasional lectures, most of which have been published. He wrote to the

suggestive, and he is always the champion of mental freedom,

returned in 1802 to plan an ill-starred insurrection, for which he was
executed 20 Sept. 1803. Emmet made a thrilling speech before receiving
sentence, and on the scaffold refused the services of a priest. It is
well known that his desire to see once more his sweetheart, the
daughter of Curran, was the cause of his capture and execution.</p>

not to offend the prejudices of the Athenians. In physics he adopted
the atomic theory, and denied immortality. He taught that pleasure is
the sovereign good; but by pleasure he meant no transient sensation,
but permanent tranquility of mind. He wrote largely, but his works are

at Erlangen, but was dismissed in consequence of his first published
work, <i>Thoughts upon Death and Immortality</i>, &rsquo;30, in which
he limited immortality to personal influence on the human race. After a
wandering life he married in &rsquo;37, and settled near Anspach. He
published there a history of modern philosophy from Bacon to Spinoza.
This was followed by a work on Peter Bayle. In &rsquo;38 he wrote on

<i>The Essence of Christianity</i>, in which he resolves theology into
anthropology. This book was translated by Mary Ann Evans, &rsquo;53. He

Revelation</i>. He obtained a chair of philosophy at Jena, where he
developed his doctrines of science, asserting that the problem of
philosophy is to seek on what foundations knowledge rests. He gave
moral discourses in the lecture-room on Sunday, and was accused of
holding atheistical opinions. He was in consequence banished from
Saxony, 1799. He appears to have held that God was not a personal
being, but a system of intellectual, moral, and spiritual laws. Fichte
took deep interest in the cause of German independence, and did much to
rouse his countrymen against the domination of the French during the
conquest which led to the fall of Napoleon. Besides many publications,
in which he expounds his philosophy, he wrote eloquent treatises on

objects of hate were &ldquo;the cross and bugs.&rdquo; He was averse to
abstractions and refused to recognise a Deity distinct from the world.
In philosophy he followed Spinoza, and he disliked and discountenanced
the popular creed. Writing to Lavater in 1772 he said: &ldquo;You look
upon the gospel as it stands as the divinest truth: but even a voice
from heaven would not convince me that water burns and fire quenches,
that a woman conceives without a man, and that a dead man can rise
again. To you, nothing is more beautiful than the Gospel; to me, a
thousand written pages of ancient and modern inspired men are equally
beautiful.&rdquo; Goethe was opposed to asceticism, and Pfleiderer
admits &ldquo;stood in opposition to Christianity not merely on points
of theological form, but to a certain extent on points of substance
too.&rdquo; Goethe devoted much attention to science, and he attempted
to explain the metamorphosis of plants on evolutionary principles in
1790. Died 22 March, 1832.</p>

<p><b>Hegel</b> (Georg Wilhelm Friedrich), German metaphysician b.
Stuttgart, 27 Aug. 1770. He studied theology at T&uuml;bingen, but,
becoming acquainted with Schelling, devoted his attention to
philosophy. His <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia of the Philosophical Sciences</i>
made a deep impression in Germany, and two schools sprang up, one
claiming it as a philosophical statement of Christianity, the other as
Pantheism hostile to revelation. Hegel said students of philosophy must
begin with Spinozism. He is said to have remarked that of all his many
disciples only one understood him, and he understood him falsely. He
was professor at Jena, Heidelberg, and Berlin, in which last city he
died 14 Nov. 1831, and was buried beside Fichte.</p>

acquainted with the philosophy of Spinoza and Hegel; graduated LL.D.,
and in June 1825 renounced Judaism and was baptised. The change was
only formal. He satirised all forms of religious faith. His fine
<i>Pictures of Travel</i> was received with favor and translated by
himself into French. His other principal works are the <i>Book of
Songs</i>, <i>History of Recent Literature in Germany</i>, <i>The
Romantic School</i>, <i>The Women of Shakespeare</i>, <i>Atta Troll</i>
and other poems. In 1835 he married a French lady, having settled in
Paris, where &ldquo;the Voltaire of Germany&rdquo; became more French
than German. About 1848 he became paralysed and lost his eyesight, but
he still employed himself in literary composition with the aid of an
amanuensis. After an illness of eight years, mostly passed in extreme
suffering on his &ldquo;mattress grave,&rdquo; he died 17 Feb. 1856.
Heine was the greatest and most influential German writer since Goethe.
He called himself a Soldier of Freedom, and his far-flashing sword
played havoc with the forces of reaction.</p>
<p><b>Heinzen</b> (Karl Peter) German-American poet, orator and

<p id="holbach"><b>Holbach</b> (Paul Heinrich Dietrich von)
<i>Baron</i>, b. Heidelsheim Jan. 1723. Brought up at Paris where he
spent most of his life. Rich and generous he was the patron of the
Encyclop&aelig;dists. Buffon, Diderot, d&rsquo;Alembert, Helvetius,
Rousseau, Grimm, Raynal, Marmontel, Condillac, and other authors often
met at his table. Hume, Garrick, Franklin, and Priestley were also
among his visitors. He translated from the German several works on
chemistry and mineralogy, and from the English, Mark Akenside&rsquo;s
<i>Pleasures of the Imagination</i>. He contributed many articles to
the <i lang="fr">Encyclop&eacute;die</i>. In 1765 he visited England,
and from this time was untiring in his issue of Freethought works,
usually put out under pseudonyms. Thus he wrote and had published at
Amsterdam <i>Christianity Unveiled</i>, attributed to Boulanger. The
<i>Spirit of the Clergy</i>, translated, from the English of Trenchard
and Gordon, was partly rewritten by d&rsquo;Holbach, 1767. His
<i>Sacred Contagion or Natural History of Superstition</i>, was also
wrongly attributed to Trenchard and Gordon. This work was condemned to
be burnt by a decree of the French parliament, 8 Aug. 1770.
D&rsquo;Holbach also wrote and published <i>The History of David</i>,
1768, <i>The Critical History of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Letters to
Eugenia</i>, attributed to Freret, <i>Portable Theology</i>, attributed
to Bernier, an <i>Essay on Prejudices</i>, attributed to M. Du M
[arsais], <i>Religious Cruelty</i>, <i>Hell Destroyed</i>, and other
works, said to be from the English. He also translated <span class=

and Collins&rsquo;s <i>Discourses on Prophecy</i>, and attributed to
the latter a work with the title <i>The Spirit of Judaism</i>. These
works were mostly conveyed to the printer, M. Rey, at Amsterdam, by
Naigeon, and the secret of their authorship was carefully preserved.
Hence d&rsquo;Holbach escaped persecution. In 1770 he published his
principal work <i>The System of Nature</i>, or <i>The Laws of the
Physical and Moral World</i>. This text-book of atheistic philosophy,
in which d&rsquo;Holbach was assisted by Diderot, professed to be the
posthumous work of Mirabaud. It made a great sensation. Within two
years he published a sort of summary under the title of <i>Good
Sense</i>, attributed to the cur&eacute; Meslier. In 1773 he wrote on
<i>Natural Politics</i> and the <i>Social System</i>. His last
important work was <i>Universal Morality; or the Duties of Man founded
upon Nature</i>. D&rsquo;Holbach, whose personal good qualities were
testified to by many, was depicted in Rousseau&rsquo;s <i lang=

church endowments to the exigencies of the State (Bath, 1786). Died 5
Nov. 1798.</p>
<p><b>Holyoake</b> (Austin), English Freethinker, b. Birmingham, 27
Oct. 1826. His mental emancipation came from hearing the lectures of
Robert Owen and his disciples. He took part in the agitation for the
abolition of the newspaper stamp&mdash;assisting when risk and danger
had to be met&mdash;and he co-operated with his brother in the
production of the <i>Reasoner</i> and other publications from &rsquo;45
till &rsquo;62. Soon after this he printed and sub-edited the
<i>National Reformer</i>, in which many of his Freethought articles
appeared. Among his pamphlets may be mentioned <i>Heaven and Hell</i>,
<i>Ludicrous Aspects of Christianity</i>, <i>Thoughts on Atheism</i>,
the <i>Book of Esther</i>, and <i>Daniel the Dreamer</i>. He also
composed a Secular Burial Service. Austin Holyoake took pride in the
character of Freethought, and was ever zealous in promoting its
welfare. His amiable spirit endeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e9454" href="#xd25e9454" name="xd25e9454">176</a>]</span>him to
all who knew him. He died 10 April, 1874, leaving behind thoughts
written on his deathbed, in which he repudiated all belief in
theology.</p>
<p><b>Holyoake</b> (George Jacob), b. Birmingham, 13 April 1817. Became
mathematical teacher of the Mechanics&rsquo; Institution. Influenced by
Combe and Owen he became a Freethinker, and in &rsquo;40 a Socialist
missionary. In &rsquo;42, when Southwell was imprisoned for writing in
the <i>Oracle of Reason</i>, Mr. Holyoake took charge of that journal,
and wrote <i>The Spirit of Bonner in the Disciples of Jesus</i>. He was
soon arrested for a speech at Cheltenham, having said, in answer to a
question, that he would put the Deity on half-pay. Tried Aug.
&rsquo;42, he was sentenced to six months imprisonment, of which he
gave a full account in his <i>Last Trial by Jury for Atheism in
England</i>. In Dec. &rsquo;43 he edited with M. Q. Ryall the
<i>Movement</i>, bearing the motto from Bentham, &ldquo;Maximise
morals, minimise religion.&rdquo; The same policy was pursued in <i>The
Reasoner</i>, which he edited from 1846 till 1861. Among his many
pamphlets we must notice the <i>Logic of Death</i>, &rsquo;50, which
went through numerous editions, and was included in his most important
Freethought work, <i>The Trial of Theism</i>. In &rsquo;49 he published
a brief memoir of R. Carlile. In &rsquo;51 he first used the term
&ldquo;Secularist,&rdquo; and in Oct. &rsquo;52 the first Secular
Conference was held at Manchester Mr. Holyoake presiding. In Jan.
&rsquo;53 he held a six nights discussion with the Rev. Brewin Grant,
and again in Oct. &rsquo;54. He purchased the business of James Watson,
and issued many Freethought works, notably <i>The Library of
Reason</i>&mdash;a series, <i>The Cabinet of Reason</i>, his own
<i>Secularism</i>, <i>The Philosophy of the People</i>, etc. In
&rsquo;60 he was Secretary to the British Legion sent out to Garibaldi.
Mr. Holyoake did much to remove the taxes upon knowledge, and has
devoted much attention to Co-operation, having written a history of the
movement and contributed to most of its journals.</p>

distinguished French scientists. After numerous important contributions
to scientific knowledge, at the age of seventy-four he composed his
celebrated <i>Cosmos</i>, the first volume of which appeared in
&rsquo;45 and the fourth in &rsquo;58. To <a href=
"#varnhagenvonense">Varnhagen von Ense</a> he wrote in 1841:
&ldquo;Bruno Bauer has found me pre-adamatically converted. Many years
ago I wrote, &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Toutes les r&eacute;ligions

Strauss disposes of &ldquo;the Christian myths.&rdquo; Humboldt was an
unwearied student of science, paying no attention to religion, and
opposed his brother in regard to his essay <i>On the Province of the
Historian</i>, because he considered it to acknowledge the belief in
the divine government of the world, which seemed to him as complete a
delusion as the hypothesis of a principle of life. He died in Berlin, 6
May, 1859, in his ninetieth year.</p>

<p><b>Hume</b> (David), philosopher and historian, b. Edinburgh, 26
April, 1711. In 1735 he went to France to study, and there wrote his
<i>Treatise on Human Nature</i>, published in 1739. This work then
excited no interest friendly or hostile. Hume&rsquo;s <i>Essays Moral
and Political</i> appeared in 1742, and in 1752 his <i>Inquiry
Concerning the Principles of Morals</i> which of all his writings he
considered the best. In 1755 he published his <i>Natural History of
Religion</i>, which was furiously attacked by Warburton in an anonymous
tract. In 1754 he published the first volume of his <i>History of
England</i>, which he did not complete till 1761. He became secretary
to the Earl of Hertford, ambassador at Paris, where he was cordially
welcomed by the philosophers. He returned in 1766, bringing Rousseau
with him. Hume became Under Secretary of State in 1767, and in 1769
retired to Edinburgh, where he died 25 Aug. 1776. After his death his
<i>Dialogues on Natural Religion</i> were published, and also some
unpublished essays on Suicide, the Immortality of the Soul, etc.
Hume&rsquo;s last days were singularly cheerful. His friend, the famous
Dr. Adam Smith, considered him &ldquo;as approaching as nearly to the
idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of
human frailty will permit.&rdquo;</p>

to pay a fine, each of &pound;500, and to be imprisoned for two years,
1812&ndash;14, for a satirical article, in which the prince regent was
called an &ldquo;Adonis of fifty.&rdquo; This imprisonment procured him
the friendship of Shelley and Byron, with whom, after editing the
<i>Indicator</i> he was associated in editing the <i>Liberal</i>. He
wrote many choice books of poems and criticisms, and in his <i>Religion

1510, and Vienna 1512, and also studied at Pavia and Bologna. He
returned to Germany in 1517 as a common soldier in the army of
Maximilian. His great object was to free his country from
sacerdotalism, and most of his writings are satires against the Pope,
monks and clergy. Persecution drove him to Switzerland, but the Council
of Zurich drove <span class="corr" id="xd25e9766" title=

May, 1825. He studied medicine, and in &rsquo;46 took M.R.C.S., and was
appointed assistant naval surgeon. His cruises afforded opportunities
for his studies of natural history. In &rsquo;51 he was elected Fellow
of the Royal Society, and in &rsquo;54 was made Professor at the School
of Mines. In &rsquo;60 he lectured on &ldquo;The Relation of Man to the
Lower Animals,&rdquo; and afterwards published <i>Evidence as to
Man&rsquo;s Place in Nature</i> (1863). In addition to numerous
scientific works, Professor Huxley has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

numerous forcible articles, addresses, etc., collected in <i>Lay
Sermons</i>, &rsquo;70; <i>Critiques and Addresses</i>, &rsquo;73; and
<i>American Addresses</i>, &rsquo;79. A vigorous writer, his
<i>Hume</i> in the &ldquo;English Men of Letters&rdquo; series is a
model of clear exposition. In his controversies with Mr. Gladstone, in
his articles on the <i>Evolution of Theology</i>, and in his recent
polemic with the Rev. Mr. Wace in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>,
Professor Huxley shows all his freshness, and proves himself as ready
in demolishing theological fictions as in demonstrating scientific
facts. He states as his own life aims &ldquo;The popularising of
science and untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit, that
clericalism, which in England, as everywhere else, and to whatever
denomination it may belong, is the deadly enemy of science.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hypatia</b>, Pagan philosopher and martyr, b. Alexandria early in
the second half of the fourth century. She became a distinguished
lecturer and head of the Neo-Platonic school (c. 400). The charms of
her eloquence brought many disciples. By a Christian mob, incited by
St. Cyril, she was in Lent 415 torn from her chariot, stripped naked,
cut with oyster-shells and finally burnt piecemeal. This true story of
Christian persecution has been disguised into a legend related of St.
Catherine in the Roman breviary (Nov. 25).</p>

member of the Academy of Sciences in his 20th year. In 1762 he became
Professor of Astronomy at the College of France. In 1764 he published
his <i>Treatise of Astronomy</i>, to which Dupuis subjoined a memoir,
which formed the basis of his <i>Origin of all Religions</i>, the idea
of which he had taken from Lalande<span class="corr" id="xd25e10628"

save Dupont de Nemours, and some priests whom he concealed in the
observatory of Mazarin college. It was upon Lalande&rsquo;s
observations that the Republican calender was drawn up. At
Lalande&rsquo;s instigation Sylvain Mar&eacute;chal published his
<i>Dictionary of Atheists</i>, to which the astronomer contributed
supplements after Mar&eacute;chal&rsquo;s death. Lalande professed
himself prouder of being an Atheist than of being an astronomer. His

the Museum of Natural History, and in 1809 propounded, in his
<i>Zoological Philosophy</i>, a theory of transmutation of species. His
<i>Natural History of Invertebrate Animals</i> (1815&ndash;22) was
justly celebrated. He became blind several years before his death, 18

<p id="lamettrie"><b>Lamettrie</b> (Julian <span class=
"sc">Offray</span> de). French physician and philosopher, b. St. Malo,
25 Dec. 1709. Destined for the Church, he was educated under the
Jesuits at Caen. He, however, became a physician, studying under
Boerhaave, at Leyden. Returning to France, he became surgeon to the
French Guard, and served at the battles of Fontenoy and Dettingen.
Falling ill, he noticed that his faculties fluctuated with his physical
state, and drew therefrom materialistic conclusions. The boldness with
which he made his ideas known lost him his place, and he took refuge in
Holland. Here he published <i>The Natural History of the Soul</i>,
under the pretence of its being a translation from the English of Charp
[Sharp], 1745. This was followed by <i>Man a Machine</i> (1748), a work
which was publicly burnt at Leyden, and orders given for the
author&rsquo;s arrest. It was translated into English, and reached a
second edition (London, 1750). It was often attributed to
D&rsquo;Argens. Lamettrie held that the senses are the only avenues to
knowledge, and that it is absurd to assume a god to explain motion.
Only under Atheism will religious strife cease. Lamettrie found an
asylum with Frederick the Great, to whom he became physician and reader
(Feb. 1748). Here he published <i>Philosophical Reflections on the
Origin of Animals</i> (1750), translated Seneca on Happiness, etc. He
died 11 Nov. 1751, and desired by his will to be buried in the garden
of Lord Tyrconnel. The great king thought so well of him that he
composed his funeral eulogy.</p>

<p><b>Morison</b> (James Augustus Cotter), English Positivist and man
of letters, b. London, 1831. Graduated at Lincoln Coll. Oxford, M.A.,

Bernard</i>. He was one of the founders of the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>, in which he wrote, as well as in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.
He contributed monographs on Gibbon and Macaulay to Morley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Men of Letters&rdquo; Series. In &rsquo;86 he published his
striking work <i>The Service of Man</i>, an Essay towards the Religion
of the Future, which shows that the benefits of Christianity have been
much exaggerated and its evils palpable. All his writings are earnest
and thoughtful. He collected books and studied to write a History of
France, which would have been a noble contribution to literature; but
the possession of a competence seems to have weakened his industry, and
he never did justice to his powers. Even the <i>Service of Man</i> was
postponed until he was no longer able to complete it as he intended.
Morison was a brilliant talker, and the centre of a wide circle of
friends. George Meredith dedicated to him a volume of poems. Died at

Wales, 14 March, 1771. At 18 he was so distinguished by his business
talents that he became partner in a cotton mill. In 1797 he married the
daughter of David Dale, and soon afterwards became partner and sole
manager at New Lanark Mills, where he built the first infant schools
and improved the dwellings of the workmen. From 1810&ndash;15 he
published <i>New Views on Society</i>, or, Essays on the Formation of
Character. In &rsquo;17 he caused much excitement by proclaiming that
the religions of the world were all false, and that man was the
creature of circumstances. In &rsquo;24 he went to America and
purchased New Harmony, Indiana, from the Rappists to found a new
community, but the experiment was a failure, as were also others at
Orbiston, Laner, and Queenswood, Hants. In &rsquo;28 he debated at
Cincinatti with Alex. Campbell on the Evidences of Christianity. He
published a numerous series of tracts, <i>Robert Owen&rsquo;s
Journal</i>, and <i>The New Moral World</i>, &rsquo;35. He debated on
his Social System with the Rev. J. H. Roebuck, R. Brindley, etc. As his
mind began to fail he accepted the teachings of Spiritism. Died Newton,
17 Nov. 1858. Owen profoundly influenced the thought of his time in the
direction of social amelioration, and he is justly respected for his
energy, integrity and disinterested philanthropy.</p>
<p><b>Owen</b> (Robert Dale), son of the above, b. Glasgow 9 Nov. 1800.
Was educated by his father till 1820, when he was sent to
Fellenberg&rsquo;s school, near Berne, Switzerland. In &rsquo;25 he
went to America to aid in the efforts to found a colony at New Harmony,
Indiana. On the failure of that experiment he began with Frances
Wright, in Nov. &rsquo;28, the publication of the <i>Free Inquirer</i>,
which was continued till &rsquo;32. In that year he had a written
discussion with O. Bachelor on the existence of God, and the
authenticity of the Bible, in which he ably championed the Freethought
cause. He wrote a number of tracts of which we mention
<i>Situations</i>, 1839; <i>Address on Free Inquiry</i>, 1840;
<i>Prossimo&rsquo;s Experience</i>, <i>Consistency</i>, <i>Galileo and
the Inquisition</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e13695" href=

Congress in &rsquo;43. After fifteen years of labor he secured the
women of Indiana independent rights of property. He became charge

part in the Provisional Government of the Neapolitan Republic in 1791,
he was taken prisoner by the royalists and executed 6 Oct. 1800.</p>

introductory and advanced text-books of geology, which went through
many editions. He gave advanced lectures in Edinburgh, and edited
<i>Life Lights of Song</i>, &rsquo;64. His <i>Man Where, Whence, and
Whither?</i>, &rsquo;67, advocating Darwinian views, made some stir in
Scotland. He became professor of geology at Durham University. A friend
of Robert Chambers, he was for some time credited with that
writer&rsquo;s <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, in the scientific details
of which he assisted. Died at Newcastle-on-Tyne, 9 March, 1879.</p>

<p><b>Paine</b> (Thomas), Deist, b. Thetford, Norfolk, 29 Jan., 1737.
His father was a Quaker and staymaker, and Paine was brought up to the
trade. He left home while still young, went to London and Sandwich,
where he married the daughter of <span class="corr" id="xd25e13765"
title="Source: a an">an</span> exciseman, and entered the excise. He
was selected by his official associates to embody their wants in a
paper, and on this work he displayed such talent that Franklin, then in
London, suggested America as a good field for his abilities. Paine went
in 1774, and soon found work for his pen. He became editor of the
<i>Pennsylvanian Magazine</i> and contributed to the Pennsylvanian
journal a strong anti-slavery essay. <i>Common Sense</i>, published
early in 1776, advocating absolute independence for America, did more
than anything else to precipitate the great events of that year. Each
number of the <i>Crisis</i>, which appeared during the war, was read by
Washington&rsquo;s order to each regiment in the service. Paine
subscribed largely to the army, and served for a short time himself.
After peace was declared, congress voted him three thousand dollars,
and the state of New York gave him a large farm. Paine turned his
attention to mechanics, and invented the tubular iron bridge, which he
endeavored to introduce in Europe. Reaching France during the
Revolution, he published a pamphlet advocating the abolition of
royalty. In 1791 he published his <i>Rights of Man</i>, in reply to
Burke. For this he was outlawed. Escaping from England, he went to
France, where he was elected to the Convention. He stoutly opposed the
execution of the king, and was thrown by Robespierre into the
Luxembourg prison, where for nearly a year he awaited the guillotine.
During this time he wrote the first part of the <i>Age of Reason</i>,
which he completed on his release. This famous book, though vulnerable
in some minor points of criticism, throws a flood of light on Christian
dogmas, and has had a more extended sale than any other Freethought
work. As a natural consequence, Paine has been an object of incessant
slander by the clergy. Paine died at New York 8 June, 1809, and, by his
own direction was buried on his farm at New <span class=

V. he retired to Sienna. In 1536 he published at Lyons an elegant Latin
poem on the Mortality of the Soul&mdash;modeled on Lucretius. He was
Professor of Eloquence at Milan for ten years, but was accused of
heresy. He had called the Inquisition a poignard directed against all
men of letters. On 3 July, 1570, he was hung and his body thrown into
the flames. A work on the Benefit of Christ&rsquo;s Death has been
attributed to him on insufficient grounds. It is attributed to
Benedetto da Mantova.</p>

teacher at Boston. In June, &rsquo;37, he was ordained Unitarian

the German critics made him a complete rationalist, so that even the
Unitarian body rejected him. A society was established to give him a

His pieces were full of wit and gaiety, and many anecdotes are told of
his profanity. Among his sallies was his reply to a reproof for being
drunk on Good Friday, that failing must be excused on a day when even
deity succumbed. Being blind in his old age he affected piety. Worried
by his confessor about a Bible in the margin of which he had written
parodies and epigrams as the best commentary, he threw the whole book

country of &ldquo;the Great Commoner,&rdquo; as he was called, are well
known, but it is not so generally recognised that his <i>Letter on
Superstition</i>, first printed in the <i>London Journal</i> in 1733,
entitles him to be ranked with the Deists. He says that &ldquo;the more
superstitious people are, always the more vicious; and the more they
<i>believe</i>, the less they practice.&rdquo; Atheism furnishes no man
with arguments to be vicious; but superstition, or what the world made
by religion, is the greatest possible encouragement to vice, by setting
up something as religion, which shall atone and commute for the want of
virtue. This remarkable letter ends with the words &ldquo;Remember that
the only true divinity is humanity.&rdquo;</p>

vulgar notions of Deity, and remarked, in connection with the deeds
popularly ascribed to the gods, that he would rather men said there was
no Plutarch than traduce his character. In other words, superstition is
more impious than Atheism. Died about <span class="sc">A.D.</span>

employment in Baltimore and wrote many stories, collected as the
<i>Tales of Mystery, Imagination, and Humor</i>. In &rsquo;45 appeared
<i>The Raven and other Poems</i>, which proved him the most musical and
dextrous of American poets. In &rsquo;48 he published <i>Eureka, a
Prose Poem</i>, which, though comparatively little known, he esteemed
his greatest work. It indicates pantheistic views of the universe. His
personal appearance was striking and one of his portraits is not unlike

professor of philosophy at Padua, teaching in concurrence with
Achillini. He afterwards taught the doctrines of Aristotle at Ferrara
and Bologna. His treatise <i>De Immortalitate Anim&aelig;</i>, 1516,
gave great offence by denying the philosophical foundation of the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul. The work was burnt by the
hangman at Venice, and it is said Cardinal Bembo&rsquo;s intercession
with Pope Leo X. only saved Pomponazzi from ecclesiastical procedure.

of Jewish faith, and first embraced and then afterwards rejected
Christianity. It is certain he was a man of learning and intelligence;
the friend as well as the disciple of Plotinus. He wrote (in Greek) a
famous work in fifteen books against the Christians, some fragments of
which alone remain in the writings of his opponents. It is certain he
showed acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian writings, exposed
their contradictions, pointed out the dispute between Peter and Paul,
and referred Daniel to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes. He wrote many
other works, among which are lives of Plotinus and Pythagorus. Died at

thought otherwise were prompted by pity for our mean estate. These
assertions are in his treatise <i>De Mente Human&acirc;</i>.

<p><b>Prades</b> (Jean Martin de), French theologian b.
Castel-Sarrasin, about 1720. Brought up for the church, he nevertheless
became intimate with Diderot and contributed the article <span class=
"sc">Certitude</span> to the Encyclop&eacute;die. On the 18th Nov. 1751
he presented to the Sorbonne a thesis for the doctorate, remarkable as
the first open attack on Christianity by a French theologian. He
maintained many propositions on the soul, the origin of society, the
laws of Moses, miracles, etc., contrary to the dogmas of the Church,
and compared the cures recorded in the Gospels to those attributed to
Esculapius. The thesis made a great scandal. His opinions were
condemned by Pope <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e14869" href=

fled to Holland for safety. Recommended to Frederick the Great by
d&rsquo;Alembert he was received with favor at Berlin, and became
reader to that monarch, who wrote a very anti-Christian preface to de
Prades&rsquo; work on ecclesiastical history, published as <i lang=

<p id="premontval"><b>Premontval</b> (Andre Pierre Le Guay de), French
writer, b. Charenton, 16 Feb. 1716. At nineteen years of age, while in
the college of Plessis Sorbonne, he composed a work against the dogma
of the Eucharist. He studied mathematics and became member of the
Academy of Sciences at Berlin. He wrote <i lang="fr">Le Diogene de

Panurgica</i>, or the false Evangelist, and <i lang="fr">Vues

ordinary proofs of the existence of a God. Died Berlin, 1767.</p>
<p><b>Priestley</b> (Joseph), LL.D., English philosopher, b. Fieldhead,
near Leeds, 18 March, 1733. Brought up as a Calvinist, he found his way
to broad Unitarianism. Famous as a pneumatic chemist, he defended the
doctrine of philosophical necessity, and in a dissertation annexed to
his edition of Hartley expressed doubts of the immateriality of the
sentient principal in man. This doctrine he forcibly supported in his
<i>Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit</i>, 1777. Through the obloquy
these works produced, he lost his position as librarian to Lord
Shelburne. He then removed to Birmingham, and became minister of an
independent Unitarian congregation, and occupied himself on his

Christianity</i> and <i>History of the Early Opinions Concerning Jesus
Christ</i>, which involved him in controversy with Bishop Horsley and
others. In consequence of his sympathy with the French Revolution, his
house was burnt and sacked in a riot, 14 July, 1791. After this he
removed to Hackney, and was finally goaded to seek an asylum in the
United States, which he reached in 1794. Even in America he endured
some uneasiness on account of his opinions until Jefferson became
president. Died 6 Feb. 1804.</p>

March, 1837. Educated at King&rsquo;s College, London, and at St.
John&rsquo;s, Cambridge, where he became B.A. in &rsquo;60. In
&rsquo;66 he became Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, of which
he afterwards became hon. sec. He maintained in &rsquo;69 the
since-established theory of the solar corona. He wrote, lectured, and
edited, far and wide, and left nearly fifty volumes, chiefly
popularising science. Attracted by Newman, he was for a while a
Catholic, but thought out the question of Catholicism and science, and
in a letter to the <i>New York Tribune</i>, Nov. &rsquo;75, formally
renounced that religion as irreconcilable with scientific facts. His
remarks on the so-called Star of Bethlehem in <i>The Universe of Suns,
and other Science Gleanings</i>, and his Sunday lectures, indicated his
heresy. In &rsquo;81 he started <i>Knowledge</i>, in which appeared
many valuable papers, notably one (Jan. &rsquo;87), &ldquo;The
Beginning of Christianity.&rdquo; He entirely rejected the miraculous
elements of the gospels, which he considered largely a
<i>rechauff&eacute;</i> of solar myths. In other articles in the
<i>Freethinkers&rsquo; Magazine</i> and the <i>Open Court</i> he
pointed out the coincidence between the Christian stories and solar
myths, and also with stories found in Josephus. The very last article
he published before his untimely death was a vindication of Colonel
Ingersoll in his controversy with Gladstone in the <i>North American
Review</i>. In &rsquo;84 he settled at St. Josephs, Mobille, where he
contracted yellow fever and died at New York, 12 Sep. 1888.</p>

for the person &ldquo;best fitted for a literary or scientific

which he made the celebrated answer &ldquo;<i lang="fr">C&rsquo;est le

appeared, treating of religion, philosophy and logic. In &rsquo;46 he
published his <i>System of Economical Contradictions</i>, in which
appeared his famous aphorism, &ldquo;<i lang="fr">Dieu, c&rsquo;est le
mal.</i>&rdquo; In &rsquo;48 he introduced his scheme of the
organisation of credit in a Bank of the People, which failed, though
Proudhon saw that no one lost anything. He attacked Louis Bonaparte
when President, and was sentenced to three years&rsquo; imprisonment
and a fine of 10,000 francs. On 2 Jan. &rsquo;50 he married by private
contract while in prison. For his work on <i>Justice in the Revolution
and in the Church</i> he was condemned to three years&rsquo;
imprisonment and 4,000 francs fine in &rsquo;58. He took refuge in
Belgium and returned in &rsquo;63. Died at Passy, 19 Jan. 1865. Among
his posthumous works was <i>The Gospels Annotated</i>, &rsquo;66.
Proudhon was a bold and profound thinker of noble aspirations, but he
lacked the sense of art and practicability. His complete works have
been published in 26 vols.</p>
<p><b>Protagoras</b>, Greek philosopher, b. Abdera, about 480
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> Is said to have been a disciple of
Democritus, and to have been a porter before he studied philosophy. He
was the first to call himself a sophist. He wrote in a book on the
gods, &ldquo;Respecting the gods, I am unable to know whether they
exist or do not exist.&rdquo; For this he was impeached and banished,
and his book burnt. He went to Epirus and the Greek Islands, and died
about 411. He believed all things were in flux, and summed up his
conclusions in the proposition that &ldquo;man is the measure of all
things, both of that which exists and that which does not exist.&rdquo;
Grote, who defends the Sophists, says his philosophy &ldquo;had the
merit of bringing into forcible relief the essentially relative nature
of cognition.&rdquo;</p>

Spanish martyr, b. Villanova (Aragon), 1509. Intended for the Church,
he left it for law, which he studied at Toulouse. He afterward studied

Trinity, against which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e17030"

Locke, in 1693 he was elected M.P. for Poole, and proposed granting
counsel to prisoners in case of treason. His health suffering, he
resigned and went to Holland, where he made the acquaintance of Bayle.
The excitement induced by the French Prophets occasioned his <i>Letters
upon Enthusiasm</i>, 1708. This was followed, by his <i>Moralists</i>
and <i lang="la">Sensus Communis</i>. In 1711 he removed to Naples,
where he died 4 Feb. 1713. His collected works were published under the

<p><b>Shakespeare</b> (William). The greatest of all dramatists, b.
Stratford-on-Avon, 23 April, 1564. The materials for writing his life
are slender. He married in his 19th year, went to London, where he

literature. Shakespeare gained wealth and reputation and retired to his
native town, where he died April 23, 1616. His dramas warrant the
inference that he was a Freethinker. Prof. J. R. Green says,
&ldquo;Often as his questionings turned to the riddle of life and
death, and leaves it a riddle to the last without heeding the common
theological solutions around him.&rdquo; His comprehensive mind
disdained endorsement of religious dogmas and his wit delighted in what
the Puritans call profanity. Mr. Birch in his <i>Inquiry into the
Philosophy and Religion of Shakespeare</i>, sustains the position that
he was an Atheist.</p>

Oxford. Here he published a pamphlet on the necessity of Atheism, for
which he was expelled <span class="corr" id="xd25e17107" title=
"Not in source">from</span> the University. His father, Sir Timothy
Shelley, also forbade him his house. He went to London, wrote <i>Queen
Mab</i>, and met Miss Westbrook, whom, in 1811, he married. After two
children had been born, they separated. In &rsquo;16 Shelley learned
that his wife had drowned herself. He now claimed the custody of his
children, but, in March, &rsquo;17, Lord Eldon decided against him,
largely on account of his opinions. Shelley had previously written <i>A
Letter to Lord Ellenborough</i>, indignantly attacking the sentence the
judge passed on D. I. Eaton for publishing Paine&rsquo;s <i>Age of
Reason</i>. On 30 Dec. &rsquo;16, Shelley married Mary, daughter of
William Godwin and Mary <span class="corr" id="xd25e17119" title=

 <pb n="iii"/> </p></div1><div1 id="pre" type="Preface"><head>Preface.</head><p>John Stuart Mill in his &#8220;Autobiography&#8221; declares with truth that &#8220;the world would be astonished if it knew how great a proportion of its brightest ornaments, of those most distinguished even in popular estimation for wisdom and virtue are complete sceptics in religion.&#8221; Many of these, as Mill points out, refrain from various motives from speaking out. The work I have undertaken will, I trust, do something to show how many of the world&#8217;s worthiest men and women have been Freethinkers.

 </p><p>My Dictionary does not pretend to be a complete list of those who have rendered services to Freethought. To form such a compilation would rather be the task of an international society than of an individual. Moreover details concerning many worthy workers are now inaccessible. Freethought boasts its noble army of martyrs of whom the world was not worthy, and who paid the penalty of their freedom in prison or at the stake. Some of the names of these are only known by the vituperation of their adversaries. I have done my best to preserve some trustworthy record of as many as possible.

 </p><p>The only complete work with a similar design of which I have any knowledge, is the <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Ath&#233;es anciens et modernes</hi>, by Sylvain Mar&#233;chal with its supplements by Jerome de Lalande the Astronomer, An. VIII. (1800)&#8211;1805. That work, which is now extremely <pb n="iv"/>rare, gave scarcely any biographical details, and unfortunately followed previous orthodox atheographers, such as Buddeus, Reimmann, Hardouin, Garasse, Mersenne, in classing as Atheists those to whom the title was inapplicable. I have taken no names from these sources without examining the evidence.

 </p><p>A work was issued by Richard Carlile in 1826, entitled <hi>A Dictionary of Modern Anti-Superstionists</hi>; or, &#8220;an account, arranged alphabetically, of those who, whether called Atheists, Sceptics, Latitudinarians, Religious Reformers, or etc., have during the last ten centuries contributed towards the diminution of superstition. Compiled by a searcher after Truth.&#8221; The compiler, as I have reason to know, was Julian Hibbert, who brought to his task adequate scholarship and leisure. It was, however, conceived on too extensive a scale, and in 128 pages, all that was issued, it only reached to the name of Annet. Julian Hibbert also compiled chronological tables of English Freethinkers, which were published in the <hi>Reasoner</hi> for 1855.

 </p><p>Of the <hi>Anti-Trinitarian Biography</hi> of the Rev. Robert Wallace, or of the previous compilations of Saudius and Bock, I have made but little use. To include the names of all who reject some of the Christian dogmas was quite beside my purpose, though I have included those of early Unitarians and Universalists who, I conceive, exhibited the true spirit of free inquiry in the face of persecution. To the <hi lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freydenker Lexikon</hi> of J. A. Trinius (1759) my obligations are slight, but should be acknowledged. To Bayle&#8217;s <hi>Dictionary</hi>, Hoefer&#8217;s <hi>Nouvelle Biographie Generale</hi>, Meyer&#8217;s <hi lang="de" xml:lang="de">Konversations Lexikon</hi>, Franck&#8217;s <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Sciences Philosophiques</hi>, and to Larousse&#8217;s <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Dictionnaire Universel</hi> I must <pb n="v"/>also express my indebtedness. In the case of disputed dates I have usually found Haydn&#8217;s <hi>Dictionary of Biography</hi> (1886) most trustworthy, but I have also consulted Oettinger&#8217;s valuable <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Moniteur des Dates</hi>.

 </p><p>The particulars have in all cases been drawn from the best available sources. I have not attempted to give a full view of any of the lives dealt with, but merely sought to give some idea of their services and relation to Freethought. Nor have I enumerated the whole of the works of authors who have often dealt with a variety of subjects. As full a list as is feasible has, however, been given of their distinctive Freethought works; and the book will, I hope, be useful to anyone wishing information as to the bibliography of Freethought. The only work of a bibliographical kind is the <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guide du Libre Penseur</hi>, by M. Alfred Verli&#232;re, but his list is very far from complete even of the French authors, with whom it is almost entirely occupied. I should also mention <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Lorgnette Philosophique</hi>, by M. Paquet, as giving lively sketches, though not biographies, of some modern French Freethinkers.

 </p><p>In the compilation of my list of names I have received assistance from my friends, Mr. G. W. Foote (to whom I am also indebted for the opportunity of publication), Mr. W. J. Birch, Mr. E. Truelove and Mr. F. Malibran. For particulars in regard to some English Freethinkers I am indebted to Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake and Mr. E. T. Craig, while Professor <corr sic="Dal Volta" resp="errata">Dalla Volta</corr>, of Florence, has kindly assisted me with some of the Italian names. I must also express my indebtedness to A. de Gubernatis, whose <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dizionario Biografico degli Scrittori Contemporanei</hi><corr sic="."/> I have found of considerable service. My thanks are also due to G. K. Fortescue, Esq., for permission to examine the titles of all Freethought works in the British Museum.

 <pb n="vi"/></p><p>Some readers may think my list contains names better omitted, while omitting others well deserving a place. I have, for instance, omitted many foreign Liberal Protestants while including Bishop Colenso, who, ostensibly, did not go so far. But my justification, if any, must be found in my purpose, which is to record the names of those who have contributed in their generation to the <hi>advance</hi> of Freethought. No one can be more conscious of the imperfections of my work than myself, but I console myself with the reflection of Plato, that &#8220;though it be the merit of a good huntsman to find game in a wide wood, it is no discredit if he do not find it all&#8221;; and the hope that what I have attempted some other will complete.

 </p><p>The most onerous part of my task has been the examination of the claims of some thousand names, mostly foreign, which find no place in this dictionary. But the work throughout has been a labor of love. I designed it as my humble contribution to the cause of Freethought, and leave it with the hope that it will contribute towards the history of &#8220;the good old cause&#8221;; a history which has yet to be written, and for which, perhaps, the time is not yet ripe.

 </p><p>Should this volume be received with an encouraging share of favor, I hope to follow it with a <hi>History of Freethought in England</hi>, for which I have long been collecting materials.

A teacher of philosophy at Paris, renowned for being loved by the celebrated Eloise. He was accused of teaching erroneous opinions, chiefly about the Creation and the Trinity, and was condemned by a council at Soissons in 1121 and by that of Sens 1140, at the instigation of St. Bernard. He was hunted about, but spent his last days as a monk at Cluni. He died 21 April, 1142. &#8220;Abelard,&#8221; observes Hallam, &#8220;was almost the first who awakened mankind, in the age of darkness, to a sympathy with intellectual excellence.&#8221;

 </p><p id="abano"><hi rend="bold">Abano</hi> (Petrus de). See <ref target="petrusdeabano">Petrus, <hi>de Abano</hi></ref>.

 </p><p id="abauzit"><hi rend="bold">Abauzit</hi> (Firmin), a French writer, descended from an Arabian family which settled in the South of France early in the ninth century, b. Uzes, 11 Nov. 1679. He travelled in Holland and became acquainted with Bayle, attained a reputation for philosophy, and was consulted by Voltaire and Rousseau. Among his works are, Reflections on the Gospels, and an essay on the Apocalypse, in which he questions the authority of that work. Died at Geneva 20 March, 1767. His <hi>Miscellanies</hi> were translated in English by E. Harwood, 1774.

 </p><p id="abbot"><hi rend="bold">Abbot</hi> (Francis Ellingwood). American Freethinker, b. Boston, 6 Nov. 1836. He graduated at Harvard University 1859, began life as a Unitarian minister, but becoming too broad for that Church, resigned in 1869. He started the <hi>Index</hi>, a journal of free religious inquiry and anti-supernaturalism, at Toledo, but since 1874 at Boston. This he edited 1870&#8211;80. In 1872 appeared his <hi>Impeachment of <corr sic="Christianty">Christianity</corr></hi>. In addition to his work on the <hi>Index</hi>, Mr. Abbot has lectured a great deal, and has contributed to the <hi>North American Review</hi> and other periodicals. <pb n="8"/>He was the first president of the American National Liberal League. Mr. Abbot is an evolutionist and Theist, and defends his views in <hi>Scientific Theism</hi>, 1886.

 </p><p id="ablaingvangiessenburg"><hi rend="bold">Ablaing van Giessenburg</hi> (R.C.) See <ref target="giessenburg">Giessenburg</ref>.

 </p><p id="abubakribnal-tufail"><hi rend="bold">Abu Bakr Ibn Al-Tufail</hi> (Abu J&#8217;afar) <hi>Al Isbili</hi>. Spanish Arabian philosopher, b. at Guadys, wrote a philosophical romance of pantheistic tendency <hi>Hai Ibn Yakdan</hi>, translated into Latin by Pocock, Oxford 1671, and into English by S. Ockley, 1711, under the title of <hi>The Improvement of Human Reason</hi>. Died at Morocco 1185.

 </p><p id="abu-fazil"><hi rend="bold">Abu-Fazil</hi> (<hi rend="sc">Abu al Fadhl ibn Mubarak</hi>, called <hi>Al Hindi</hi>), vizier to the great Emperor Akbar from 1572. Although by birth a Muhammadan, his investigations into the religions of India made him see equal worth in all, and, like his master, Akbar, he was tolerant of all sects. His chief work is the <hi>Ayin Akbary</hi>, a statistical account of the Indian Empire. It was <corr sic="trauslated" resp="errata">translated</corr> by F. Gladwin, 1777. He was assassinated 1604.

 </p><p id="abul-abbas-abdallahiii"><hi rend="bold">Abul-Abbas-Abdallah III.</hi> (Al Mamoun), the seventh Abbasside, caliph, son of Haroun al Rashid, was b. at Bagdad 16 Sept. 786.

Died in war near Tarsus, 9 Aug. 833.

 </p><p id="abul-ola"><hi rend="bold">Abul-Ola</hi> (<hi rend="sc">Ahmad ibn Abd Allah ibn Sulaiman</hi>), celebrated Arabian poet, b. at Maari, in Syria, Dec., 973. His free opinions gave much scandal to devout Moslems. He was blind through small-pox from the age of four years, but his poems exhibit much knowledge. He called himself &#8220;the doubly imprisoned captive,&#8221; in allusion to his seclusion and loss of sight. He took no pains to conceal that he believed in no revealed religion. Died May, 1057, and ordered the following verse to be written on his tomb:&#8212;&#8220;I owe this to the fault of my father: none owe the like to mine.&#8221;

 </p><p id="abutahir"><hi rend="bold">Abu Tahir</hi> (al Karmatti), the chief of a freethinking sect at Bahrein, on the Persian Gulf, who with a comparatively small number of followers captured Mecca (930), and took away the black stone. He suddenly attacked, defeated, and took prisoner Abissaj whom, at the head of thirty thousand men, the caliph had sent against him. Died in 943.

 <pb n="9"/></p><p id="achillini"><hi rend="bold">Achillini</hi> (Alessandro), Italian physician and philosopher b. Bologna 29 Oct. 1463. He expounded the doctrines of Averroes, and wrote largely upon anatomy. Died 2 Aug. 1512. His collected works were published at Venice, 1545.

 </p><p id="ackermann"><hi rend="bold">Ackermann</hi> (Louise-Victorine, n&#233;e <hi rend="sc">Choquet</hi>), French poetess, b. Paris 30 Nov. 1813. She travelled to Germany and there married (<corr sic="1858">1853</corr>) a young theologian, Paul Ackerman, who in preparing for the ministry lost his Christian faith, and who, after becoming teacher to Prince Frederick William (afterwards Frederick III.), died at the age of thirty-four (1846). Both were friends of Proudhon. Madame Ackermann&#8217;s poems (Paris 1863&#8211;74 and 85) exhibit her as a philosophic pessimist and Atheist. &#8220;God is dethroned,&#8221; says M. Caro of her poems (<hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, 15 May, 1874). She professes hatred of Christianity and its interested professors. She has also published <hi>Thoughts of a Solitary</hi>. Sainte Beuve calls her &#8220;the learned solitary of Nice.&#8221;

 </p><p id="acollas"><hi rend="bold">Acollas</hi> (Pierre Antoine Ren&#233; Paul Emile), French jurisconsult and political writer, b. La Ch&#226;tre 25 June, 1826, studied law at Paris. For participating in the Geneva congress of the International Society in 1867 he was condemned to one year&#8217;s imprisonment. In 1871 he was appointed head of the law faculty by the Commune. He has published several manuals popularising the legal rights of the people, and has written on <hi>Marriage its Past, Present, and Future</hi>, 1880. Mrs. Besant has translated his monograph on <hi>The Idea of God in the Revolution</hi>, published in the <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Droits de l&#8217;Homme</foreign>.

 </p><p id="acontius"><hi rend="bold">Acontius</hi> (Jacobus&#8212;<hi>Italian</hi>, Giacomo Aconzio). Born at Trent early in sixteenth century. After receiving ordination in the Church of Rome he relinquished that faith and fled to Switzerland in 1557. He subsequently came to England and served Queen Elizabeth as a military engineer. To her he dedicated his <hi>Strategems of Satan</hi>, published at Basle 1565. This was one of the earliest latitudinarian works, and was placed upon the <hi>Index</hi>. It was also bitterly assailed by Protestant divines, both in England and on the Continent. An English translation appeared in 1648. Some proceedings were taken against Acontius before Bishop Grindall, of the result of which no account is given. Some passages of Milton&#8217;s <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Areopagitica</hi> <pb n="10"/>may be traced to Acontius, who, Cheynell informs us, lived till 1623. Stephen&#8217;s <hi>Dictionary of National Biography</hi> says he is believed to have died shortly after 1566.

 </p><p id="acosta"><hi rend="bold">Acosta</hi> (Uriel). Born at Oporto 1597, the son of a Christianised Jew; he was brought up as a Christian, but on reaching maturity, rejected that faith. He went to Holland, where he published a work equally criticising Moses and Jesus. For this he was excommunicated by the Synagogue, fined and put in prison by the Amsterdam authorities, and his work suppressed. After suffering many indignities from both Jews and Christians, he committed suicide 1647.

 </p><p id="adamsg"><hi rend="bold">Adams</hi> (George), of Bristol, sentenced in 1842 to one month&#8217;s imprisonment for selling the <hi>Oracle of Reason</hi>.

 </p><p id="adamsrc"><hi rend="bold">Adams</hi> (Robert C.), Canadian Freethought writer and lecturer. Author of <hi>Travels in Faith from Tradition to Reason</hi> (New York, 1884), also <hi>Evolution, a Summary of Evidence</hi>.

 </p><p id="adlerf"><hi rend="bold">Adler</hi> (Felix) Ph. D. American Freethinker, the son of a Jewish rabbi, was b. in Alzey, Germany, 13 Aug. 1851. He graduated at Columbia College, 1870, was professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature at Cornell University from &#8217;74 to May &#8217;76, when he established in New York the Society of Ethical Culture, to which he discourses on Sundays. In 1877 he published a volume entitled <hi>Creed and Deed</hi>, in which he rejects supernatural religion. Dr. Adler has also contributed many papers to the Radical literature of America.

 </p><p id="aenesidemus"><hi rend="bold">&#198;nesidemus.</hi> A Cretan sceptical philosopher of the first century. He adopted the principle of Heraclitus, that all things were in course of change, and argued against our knowledge of ultimate causes.

 </p><p id="airy"><hi rend="bold">Airy</hi> (Sir George Biddell). English Astronomer Royal, b. Alnwick 27 July, 1801. Educated at Cambridge, where he became senior wrangler 1823. During a long life Professor Airy did much to advance astronomical science. His <hi>Notes on the Earlier Hebrew Scriptures</hi> 1876, proves him to have been a thorough-going Freethinker.

 </p><p id="aitkenhead"><hi rend="bold">Aitkenhead</hi> (Thomas), an Edinburgh student aged eighteen, who was indicted for blasphemy, by order of the Privy Council, for having called the Old Testament &#8220;Ezra&#8217;s Fables,&#8221; <pb n="11"/>and having maintained that God and nature were the same. He was found guilty 24 Dec. 1696, and hanged for blasphemy, 8 Jan. 1697.

 </p><p id="aitzema"><hi rend="bold">Aitzema</hi> (Lieuwe van), a nobleman of Friesland, b. at Dorckum 19 Nov. 1600, author of a suppressed History of the Netherlands, between 1621&#8211;68. Is classed by Reimmann as an Atheist. Died at the Hague 23 Feb. 1669.

 </p><p id="akbar"><hi rend="bold">Akbar</hi> (Jalal-ed-din Muhammad), the greatest of the emperors of Hindostan, b. 15 Oct. 1542, was famous for his wide administration and improvement of the empire. Akbar showed toleration alike to Christians, Muhammadans, and to all forms of the Hindu faith. He had the Christian gospels and several Brahmanical treatises translated into Persian. The result of his many conferences on religion between learned men of all sects, are collected in the <hi>Dabistan</hi>. Akbar was brought up as a Muhammadan, but became a Theist, acknowledging one God, but rejecting all other dogmas. Died Sept. 1605.

 </p><p id="alberger"><hi rend="bold">Alberger</hi> (John). American author of <hi>Monks, Popes, and their Political Intrigues</hi> (Baltimore, 1871) and <hi>Antiquity of Christianity</hi> (New York, 1874).

 </p><p id="albini"><hi rend="bold">Albini</hi> (Giuseppe). Italian physiologist, b. Milan. In 1845 he studied medicine in Paris. He has written on embryology and many other physiological subjects.

 </p><p id="alchindus"><hi rend="bold">Alchindus.</hi> <hi rend="sc">Yakub ibn Is&#8217;hak ibn Subbah</hi> (Ab&#250; Y&#250;suf) called <hi>Al Kindi</hi>, Arab physician and philosopher, the great grandson of one of the companions of Muhammad, the prophet, flourished from 814 to about 840. He was a rationalist in religion, and for his scientific studies he was set down as a magician.

 </p><p id="alciati"><hi rend="bold">Alciati</hi> (Giovanni Paolo). A Milanese of noble family. At first a Romanist, he resigned that faith for Calvinism, but gradually advanced to Anti-trinitarianism, which he defends in two letters to Gregorio Pauli, dated Austerlitz 1564 and 1565. Beza says that Alciati deserted the Christian faith and became a Muhammadan, but Bayle takes pains to disprove this. Died at Dantzic about 1570.

 </p><p id="aleardi"><hi rend="bold">Aleardi</hi> (Gaetano). Italian poet, known as Aleardo Aleardi, <pb n="12"/>b. Verona, 4 Nov. 1812. He was engaged in a life-long struggle against the Austrian dominion, and his patriotic poems were much admired. In 1859 he was elected deputy to Parliament for Brescia. Died Verona, 16 July, 1878.

 </p><p id="alembert"><hi rend="bold">Alembert</hi> (Jean le Rond d&#8217;), mathematician and philosopher, b. at Paris 16 Nov. 1717. He was an illegitimate son of Canon Destouches and Mme. Tencin, and received his Christian name from a church near which he was exposed as a foundling. He afterwards resided for forty years with his nurse, nor would he leave her for the most tempting offers. In 1741, he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. In 1749, he obtained the prize medal from the Academy of Berlin, for a discourse on the theory of winds. In 1749, he solved the problem of the procession of the equinoxes and explained the mutation of the earth&#8217;s axis. He next engaged with Diderot, with whose opinions he was in complete accord, in compiling the famous <hi>Encyclop&#233;die</hi>, for which he wrote the preliminary discourse. In addition to this great work he published many historical, philosophical and scientific essays, and largely corresponded with Voltaire. His work on the Destruction of the Jesuits is a caustic and far-reaching production. In a letter to Frederick the Great, he says: &#8220;As for the existence of a supreme intelligence, I think that those who deny it advance more than they can prove, and scepticism is the only reasonable course.&#8221; He goes on to say, however, that experience invincibly proves the materiality of the &#8220;soul.&#8221; Died 29 Oct. 1783. In 1799 two volumes of his posthumous essays were printed in Paris. His works prove d&#8217;Alembert to have been of broad spirit and of most extensive knowledge.

 </p><p id="alfieri"><hi rend="bold">Alfieri</hi> (Vittorio), Count. Famous Italian poet and dramatist, b. Asti, Piedmont, 17 Jan. 1749, of a noble family. His tragedies are justly celebrated, and in his <hi>Essay on Tyranny</hi> he shows himself as favorable to religious as to political liberty. Written in his youth, this work was revised at a more advanced age, the author remarking that if he had no longer the courage, or rather the fire, necessary to compose it, he nevertheless retained intelligence, independence and judgment enough to approve it, and to let it stand as the last of his literary productions. His attack is chiefly directed against Catholicism, but he does not spare Christianity. &#8220;Born among a people,&#8221; <pb n="13"/>he says, &#8220;slavish, ignorant, and already entirely subjugated by priests, the Christian religion knows only how to enjoin the blindest obedience, and is unacquainted even with the name of liberty.&#8221; Alfieri&#8217;s tragedy of <hi>Saul</hi> has been prohibited on the English stage. Died Florence, 8 Oct. 1803.

 </p><p id="alfonsox"><hi rend="bold">Alfonso X.</hi>, surnamed the Wise, King of Castillo and of Leon; b. in 1223, crowned 1252. A patron of science and lover of astronomy. He compiled a complete digest of Roman, feudal and canon law, and had drawn up the astronomical tables called Alfonsine Tables. By his liberality and example he gave a great impulse to Spanish literature. For his intercourse with Jews and Arabians, his independence towards the Pope and his free disposal of the clerical revenues, he has been stigmatised as an Atheist. To him is attributed the well-known remark that had he been present at the creation of the world he would have proposed some <corr sic="improvents">improvements</corr>. Father Lenfant adds the pious lie that &#8220;The king had scarcely pronounced this blasphemy when a thunderbolt fell and reduced his wife and two children to ashes.&#8221; Alfonso X. died 4 April, 1284.

 </p><p id="algarotti"><hi rend="bold">Algarotti</hi> (Francesco), Count. Italian writer and art critic, b. at Venice, 11 Dec. 1712. A visit to England led him to write <hi>Newtonianism for the Ladies</hi>. He afterwards visited Berlin and became the friend both of Voltaire and of Frederick the Great, who appointed him his Chamberlain. Died with philosophical composure at Pisa, 3 May, 1764.

 </p><p id="alger"><hi rend="bold">Alger</hi> (William Rounseville), b. at Freetown, Massachusetts, 30 Dec. 1822, educated at Harvard, became a Unitarian preacher of the advanced type.

He was at one time a schoolmaster and invented a system of shorthand. Priestley learnt it at school and corresponded with Annet. In 1739 he published a pamphlet on <hi>Freethinking the Great Duty of Religion</hi>, by P. A., minister of religion. This was followed by <hi>the Conception of Jesus as the Foundation of the Christian Religion</hi>, in which he boldly attacks the doctrine of the Incarnation as &#8220;a legend of the Romanists,&#8221; and <hi>The Resurrection of Jesus Considered</hi> (1744) in answer to Bishop Sherlock&#8217;s <hi>Trial of the Witnesses</hi>.

In 1877 Mr. Arnold published <hi>Last Essays on Church and State</hi>. Mr. Arnold has a lucid style and is abreast of the thought of his age, but he curiously unites rejection of supernaturalism, <pb n="21"/>including a personal God, with a fond regard for the Church of England.

Verus. <pb n="23"/>On the death of Verus in 169 Antoninus possessed sole authority, which he exercised with wise discretion and great glory. Much of his time was employed in defending the northern frontiers of the empire against Teutonic barbarians. He had no high opinion of Christians, speaking of their obstinacy, and it is pretended many were put to death in the reign of one of the best emperors that ever ruled. If so we may be assured it was for their crimes. Ecclesiastical historians have invented another pious miracle in a victory gained through the prayers of the Christians. Antoninus held that duty was indispensable even were there no gods. His <hi>Meditations</hi>, written in the midst of a most active life, breathe a lofty morality, and are a standing refutation of the view that pure ethics depend upon Christian belief.

For this he was sorry afterwards, and told Lord Stanley of Alderley &#8220;I could have written a much better essay on the other side.&#8221; He afterwards wrote on the other side in the <hi>Westminster Review</hi>. Successful as a lawyer, he retired in ill-health. J. S. Mill writes highly of his influence. The Hon. L. A. Tollemache gives a full account of his heretical opinions.

His genius early displayed itself, and at the age of five he was set to study the works of Handel and Bach. His many compositions are the glory of music. They include an opera &#8220;Fidelio,&#8221; two masses, oratorios, symphonies, concertos, overtures and sonatas, and are characterised by penetrating power, rich imagination, intense passion, and tenderness. When about the age of forty he became totally deaf, but continued to compose till his death at Vienna, 26 March, 1827. He regarded Goethe with much the same esteem as Wagner showed for Schopenhauer, but he disliked his courtliness. His Republican sentiments are well known, and Sir George Macfarren, in his life in the <hi>Imperial Dictionary of Universal Biography</hi>, speaks of him as a &#8220;Freethinker,&#8221; and says the remarkable mass in C. &#8220;might scarcely have proceeded from an entirely orthodox thinker.&#8221; Sir George Grove, in his <hi>Dictionary of Music and Musicians</hi>, says: &#8220;Formal religion he apparently had none,&#8221; and &#8220;the Bible does not appear to have been one of his favorite books.&#8221; At the end of his arrangement of &#8220;Fidelio&#8221; Moscheles had written, &#8220;Fine.

At the age of fifteen he joined the Shaker Society in New Lebanon. Here he stayed thirteen years and then married. Having lost faith in the Shaker creed, he went to Louisville, Kentucky, where he started a drug store. The perusal of Paine, Volney, and similar works made him a Freethinker.

Bentham is justly regarded as the father of the school of philosophical Radicalism. In philosophy he is the great teacher of Utilitarianism; as a jurist he did much to disclose the defects of and improve our system of law. Macaulay says he &#8220;found jurisprudence a gibberish and left it a science.&#8221; His most pronounced Freethought work was that written in conjunction with Grote, published as <hi>An Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion</hi>, by Philip Beauchamp, 1822.

In Dec. &#8217;67 she married the Rev. F. Besant, and read and wrote extensively. The torment a child underwent in whooping-cough caused doubts as to the goodness of God. A study of Greg&#8217;s <hi>Creed of Christendom</hi> and Arnold&#8217;s <hi>Literature and Dogma</hi> increased her scepticism. She became acquainted with the Rev. C.

 </p><p id="bruno"><hi rend="bold">Bruno</hi> (Giordano), Freethought martyr, b. at Nola, near Naples, about 1548. He was christened Filippo which he changed to Filoteo, taking the name of Giordano when he entered the Dominican order. Religious doubts and bold strictures on the monks obliged him to quit Italy, probably in 1580. He went to Geneva but soon found it no safe abiding place, and quitted it for Paris, where he taught, but refused to attend mass. In 1583 he visited England, living with the French ambassador Castelnau. Having formed a friendship with Sir Philip Sidney, he dedicated to him his <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Spaccio della Bestia Triomfante</hi>, a satire on all mythologies. In 1585 he took part in a logical tournament, sustaining the Copernican theory against the doctors of Oxford. The following year he returned to Paris, where he again attacked the Aristotelians. He then travelled to various cities in Germany, everywhere preaching the broadest heresy. He published several Pantheistic, scientific and philosophical works. He was however induced to return to Italy, and arrested as an heresiarch and apostate at Venice, Sept. 1592. After being confined for seven years by the Inquisitors, he was tried, and burnt at Rome 17 Feb. 1600. At his last moments a crucifix was offered him, which he nobly rejected. Bruno was vastly before his age in his conception of the universe and his rejection of theological dogmas. A statue of this heroic apostle of liberty and light, executed by one of the first sculptors of Italy, is to be erected on the spot where <pb n="57"/>he perished, the Municipal Council of Rome having granted the site in face of the bitterest opposition of the Catholic party.

He returned to Scotland and became distinguished for his learning. James V. appointed him tutor to his natural son. He composed his <hi>Franciscanus et Fratres</hi>, a satire on the monks, which hastened the Scottish reformation. This exposed him to the vengeance of the clergy. Not content with calling him Atheist, Archbishop Beaton had him arrested and confined in St. Andrew&#8217;s Castle, from whence he escaped and fled to England. Here he found, as he said, Henry VIII. burning men of opposite opinions at the same stake for religion. He returned to Paris, but was again subjected to the persecution of Beaton, the Scottish Ambassador. On the death of a patron at Bordeaux, in 1548, he was seized by the Inquisition and immured for a year and a half in a monastery, where he translated the Psalms into Latin. He eventually returned to Scotland, where he espoused the party of Moray. After a most active life, he died 28 Sept. 1582, leaving a History of Scotland, besides numerous poems, satires, and political writings, the most important of which is a work of republican tendency, <hi>De Jure Regni</hi>, the <hi>Rights of Kings</hi>.

His mother was a strict Calvinist, his father a strong Tory, but a visit to the Continent made him a Freethinker and Radical. He ever afterwards held travelling to be the best education. It was his ambition to write a <hi>History of Civilisation in England</hi>, but so vast was his design that his three notable volumes with that title form only part of the introduction. The first appeared in 1858, and created a great sensation by its boldness. In the following year he championed the cause of Pooley, who was condemned for blasphemy, and dared the prosecution of infidels of standing. In 1861 he visited the East, in the hope of improving his health, but died at Damascus, 29 May, 1862. Much of the material collected for his History has been published in his <hi>Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works</hi>, edited by Helen Taylor, 1872.

He was chief of the staff of the Osmanli cavalry in the Crimean war, and has made many remarkable and dangerous expeditions in unknown lands; he discovered and opened the lake regions in Central Africa and explored the highlands of Brazil. He has been consul at Fernando Po, Santos, Damascus, and since 1872 at Trieste, and speaks over thirty languages. His latest work is a new translation of <hi>The Thousand Nights and a Night</hi> in 10 vols. Being threatened with a prosecution, he intended justifying &#8220;literal naturalism&#8221; from the Bible.

His power was, however, first shown in his <hi>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</hi>, in which he satirised his critics, 1809. He then travelled on the Continent, the result of which was seen in his <hi>Childe Harold&#8217;s Pilgrimage</hi> and other works. He married 2 Jan. 1815, but a separation took place in the following year. Lord Byron then resided in Italy, where he made the acquaintance of Shelley. In 1823 he devoted his name and fortune to the cause of the Greek revolution, but was seized with fever and died at Missolonghi, 19 April, 1824. His drama of <hi>Cain: a Mystery</hi>, 1822, is his most serious utterance, and it shows a profound contempt for religious dogma. This feeling is also exhibited in his magnificent burlesque poem, <hi>The Vision of Judgment</hi>, which places him at the head of English satirists. In his letters to the Rev.

In a work entitled <hi>Demonum Investigatio</hi>, he contends that &#8220;possession&#8221; by devils is amenable to medical treatment. His <hi>Qu&#230;stionum Peripateticarum</hi>, in five books, Geneva, 1568, was condemned as teaching a Pantheistic doctrine similar to that of Spinoza. Bishop Parker denounced him.

His life, the particulars of which are well known, was an extraordinary display of versatility, energy, courage, and magnanimity. He justified the well-known line of Pope, &#8220;C&#230;sar the world&#8217;s great master and his own.&#8221; His military talents elevated him to the post of dictator, but this served to raise against him a band of aristocratic conspirators, by whom he was assassinated, 15 March, 44 <hi rend="sc">B.C.</hi> His <hi>Commentaries</hi> are a model of insight and clear expression. Sallust relates that he questioned the existence of a future state in the presence of the Roman senate. Froude says: &#8220;His own writings contain nothing to indicate that he himself had any religious belief at all. He saw no evidence that the gods practically interfered in human affairs.... He held to the facts of this life and to his own convictions; and as he found no reason for supposing that there was a life beyond the grave he did not pretend to expect it.&#8221;

 </p><p id="cahuac"><hi rend="bold">Cahuac</hi> (John), bookseller, revised an edition of Palmer&#8217;s <hi>Principles of Nature</hi>, 1819.

 </p><p id="campanella"><hi rend="bold">Campanella</hi> (Tommaso), Italian philosopher, b. Stilo, Calabria, 5 Sept. 1568. He entered the Dominican order, but was too much attracted by the works of Telesio to please his superiors. In 1590 his <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Philosophia Sensibus Demonstratio</hi> was printed at Naples. Being prosecuted, he fled to Rome, and thence to Florence, Venice, and Padua. At Bologna some of his MS. fell into the hands of the Inquisition, and he was arrested. He ably defended himself and was acquitted. Returning to Calabria in 1599, he was arrested on charges of heresy and conspiracy against the Spanish Government of Naples, and having appealed to Rome, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in the prison of the Holy Office.

On 15 May, 1626, he was released by the intervention of Pope Urban VIII. He was obliged to fly from Rome to France, where he met Gassendi. He also visited Descartes in Holland. Julian Hibbert remarked that his <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atheismus Triumphatus</hi>&#8212;Atheism Subdued, 1631, would be better entitled <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atheismus Triumphans</hi>&#8212;Atheism Triumphant&#8212;as the author puts his strongest arguments on the heterodox side. In his <hi>City of the Sun</hi>, Campanella follows Plato and More in depicting an ideal republic and a time when a new era of earthly felicity should begin. Hallam says &#8220;The strength of Campanella&#8217;s genius lay in his imagination.&#8221; His &#8220;Sonnets&#8221; have been translated by J. A. Symonds. Died Paris, 21 May, 1639.

 </p><p id="cardano"><hi rend="bold">Cardano</hi> (Girolamo), better known as <hi rend="sc">Jerome Cardan</hi>, Italian mathematician, and physician, b. Pavia, 24 Sept. 1501. He studied medicine, but was excluded from the Milan College of Physicians on account of illegitimate birth. He and his young wife were at one time compelled to take refuge in the workhouse. It is not strange that his first work was an exposure of the fallacies of the faculty. A fortunate cure brought him into notice and he journeyed to Scotland as the medical adviser of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, 1551. In 1563 he was arrested at Bologna for heresy, but was released, although deprived of his professorship. He died at Rome, 20 Sept. 1576, having, it is said, starved himself to verify his own prediction of his death. Despite some superstition, Cardano did much to forward science, especially by his work on Algebra, and in his works <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Subtilitate Rerum</hi> and <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Varietate Rerum</hi>, amid much that is fanciful, perceived the universality of natural law and the progressive evolution of life.

 </p><p id="collins"><hi rend="bold">Collins</hi> (Anthony), English Deist, b. Heston, Middlesex, 21 June, 1676. He studied at Cambridge and afterwards at the Temple, and became Justice of the Peace and Treasurer of the County of Essex. He was an intimate friend of Locke, who highly esteemed him and made him his executor. He wrote an <hi>Essay on Reason</hi>, 1707; <hi>Priestcraft in Perfection</hi>, 1710; a <hi>Vindication of the Divine Attributes</hi>, and a <hi>Discourse on Freethinking</hi>, 1713. This last occasioned a great outcry, as it argued that all belief must be based on free inquiry, and that the use of reason would involve the abandonment of supernatural revelation. In 1719 he published <hi>An Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty</hi>, a brief, pithy defence of necessitarianism, and in 1729 <hi>A Discourse on Liberty <pb n="84"/>and Necessity</hi>. In 1724 appeared his <hi>Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion</hi>, and this was followed by <hi>The Scheme of Literal Prophecy Considered</hi>, 1726. He was a skilful disputant, and wrote with great ability. He is also credited with <hi>A Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing</hi>. Died at London, 13 Dec. 1729. Collins, says Mr. Leslie Stephen, &#8220;appears to have been an amiable and upright man, and to have made all readers welcome to the use of a free library.&#8221; Professor Fraser calls him &#8220;a remarkable man,&#8221; praises his &#8220;love of truth and moral courage,&#8221; and allows that in answering Dr. Samuel Clarke on the question of liberty and necessity he &#8220;states the arguments against human freedom with a logical force unsurpassed by any necessitarian.&#8221; A similar testimony to Collins as a thinker and dialectician is borne by Professor Huxley.

Educated at Paris in the Polytechnic School, where he distinguished himself by his mathematical talent. In 1817 he made the acquaintance of St. Simon, agreeing with him as to the necessity of a Social renovation based upon a mental revolution. On the death of St. Simon (&#8217;25) Comte devoted himself to the elaboration of an original system of scientific thought, which, in the opinion of some able judges, entitles him to be called the Bacon of the nineteenth century. Mill speaks of him as the superior of Descartes and Leibniz. In &#8217;25 he married, but the union proved unhappy. In the following year he lectured, but broke down under an attack of brain fever, which occasioned his detention in an asylum. He speedily recovered, and in &#8217;28 resumed his lectures, which were attended by men like Humboldt, Ducrotay, Broussais, Carnot, etc. In &#8217;30 he put forward the first volumes of his <pb n="86"/><hi>Course of Positive Philosophy</hi>, which in &#8217;42 was completed by the publication of the sixth volume. A condensed English version of this work was made by Harriet Martineau, &#8217;53. In &#8217;45 Comte formed a passionate Platonic attachement to Mme. Clotilde de Vaux, who died in the following year, having profoundely influenced Comte&#8217;s life. In consequence of his opinions, he lost his professorship, and was supported by his disciples&#8212;Mill, Molesworth and Grote, in England, assisting.

He also wrote on Positive Logic, which he intended to follow with Positive Morality and Positive Industrialism. Comte was a profound and suggestive thinker. He resolutely sets aside all theology and metaphysics, coordinates the sciences and substitutes the service of man for the worship of God. Mr. J. Cotter Morison says &#8220;He belonged to that small class of rare minds, whose errors are often more valuable and stimulating than other men&#8217;s truths.&#8221; He died of cancer in the stomach at Paris, 5 Sept. 1857.

In 1791 he represented Paris in the National Assembly, of which he became Secretary. It was on his motion that, in the following year, all orders of nobility were abolished. Voting against the death of the king and siding with the Gironde drew on him the vengeance of the extreme party. He took shelter with Madame Vernet, but fearing to bring into trouble her and his wife, at whose instigation he wrote his fine <hi>Sketch of the Progress of the Human Mind</hi> while in hiding, he left, but, being arrested, died of exhaustion or by poison self-administered, at Bourg la Reine, 27 March, 1794.

On his return he settled at Concord, giving occasional lectures, most of which have been published. He wrote to the <hi>Dial</hi>, a transcendentalist paper. Tending to idealistic pantheism, but without systematic philosophy, all his writings are most suggestive, and he is always the champion of mental freedom, self-reliance, and the free pursuit of science. Died at Concord, 27 April, 1882. Matthew Arnold has pronounced his essays &#8220;the most important work done in prose&#8221; in this century.

Emmet made a thrilling speech before receiving sentence, and on the scaffold refused the services of a priest.

In philosophy he followed Spinoza, and he disliked and discountenanced the popular creed. Writing to Lavater in 1772 he said: &#8220;You look upon the gospel as it stands as the divinest truth: but even a voice from heaven would not convince me that water burns and fire quenches, that a woman conceives without a man, and that a dead man can rise again. To you, nothing is more beautiful than the Gospel; to me, a thousand written pages of ancient and modern inspired men are equally beautiful.&#8221; Goethe was opposed to asceticism, and Pfleiderer admits &#8220;stood in opposition to Christianity not merely on points of theological form, but to a certain extent on points of substance too.&#8221; Goethe devoted much attention to science, and he attempted to explain the metamorphosis of plants on evolutionary principles in 1790.

Rich and generous he was the patron of the Encyclop&#230;dists. Buffon, Diderot, d&#8217;Alembert, Helvetius, Rousseau, Grimm, Raynal, Marmontel, Condillac, and other authors often met at his table. Hume, Garrick, Franklin, and Priestley were also among his visitors.

He contributed many articles to the <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encyclop&#233;die</hi>. In 1765 he visited England, and from this time was untiring in his issue of Freethought works, usually put out under pseudonyms. Thus he wrote and had published at Amsterdam <hi>Christianity Unveiled</hi>, attributed to Boulanger. The <hi>Spirit of the Clergy</hi>, translated, from the English of Trenchard and Gordon, was partly rewritten by d&#8217;Holbach, 1767. His <hi>Sacred Contagion or Natural History of Superstition</hi>, was also wrongly attributed to Trenchard and Gordon. This work was condemned to be burnt by a decree of the French parliament, 8 Aug. 1770. D&#8217;Holbach also wrote and published <hi>The History of David</hi>, 1768, <hi>The Critical History of Jesus Christ</hi>, <hi>Letters to Eugenia</hi>, attributed to Freret, <hi>Portable Theology</hi>, attributed to Bernier, an <hi>Essay on Prejudices</hi>, attributed to M.

These works were mostly conveyed to the printer, M. Rey, at Amsterdam, by Naigeon, and the secret of their authorship was carefully preserved. Hence d&#8217;Holbach escaped persecution. In 1770 he published his principal work <hi>The System of Nature</hi>, or <hi>The Laws of the Physical and Moral World</hi>. This text-book of atheistic philosophy, in which d&#8217;Holbach was assisted by Diderot, professed to be the posthumous work of Mirabaud. It made a great sensation. Within two years he published a sort of summary under the title of <hi>Good Sense</hi>, attributed to the cur&#233; Meslier. In 1773 he wrote on <hi>Natural Politics</hi> and the <hi>Social System</hi>. His last important work was <hi>Universal Morality; or the Duties of Man founded upon Nature</hi>.

After his death his <hi>Dialogues on Natural Religion</hi> were published, and also some unpublished essays on Suicide, the Immortality of the Soul, etc. Hume&#8217;s last days were singularly cheerful. His friend, the famous Dr. Adam Smith, considered him &#8220;as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.&#8221;

After some wild adventures he went to Wittenberg in 1510, and Vienna 1512, and also studied at Pavia and Bologna. He returned to Germany in 1517 as a common soldier in the army of Maximilian.

A vigorous writer, his <hi>Hume</hi> in the &#8220;English Men of Letters&#8221; series is a model of clear exposition. In his controversies with Mr. Gladstone, in his articles on the <hi>Evolution of Theology</hi>, and in his recent polemic with the Rev. Mr. Wace in the <hi>Nineteenth Century</hi>, Professor Huxley shows all his freshness, and proves himself as ready in demolishing theological fictions as in demonstrating scientific facts. He states as his own life aims &#8220;The popularising of science and untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit, that clericalism, which in England, as everywhere else, and to whatever denomination it may belong, is the deadly enemy of science.&#8221;

This true story of Christian persecution has been disguised into a legend related of St. Catherine in the Roman breviary (Nov. 25).

Returning to France, he became surgeon to the French Guard, and served at the battles of Fontenoy and Dettingen. Falling ill, he noticed that his faculties fluctuated with his physical state, and drew therefrom materialistic conclusions. The boldness with which he made his ideas known lost him his place, and he took refuge in Holland. Here he published <hi>The Natural History of the Soul</hi>, under the pretence of its being a translation from the English of Charp [Sharp], 1745.

It was translated into English, and reached a second edition (London, 1750). It was often attributed to D&#8217;Argens. Lamettrie held that the senses are the only avenues to knowledge, and that it is absurd to assume a god to explain motion. Only under Atheism will religious strife cease. Lamettrie found an asylum with Frederick the Great, to whom he became physician and reader (Feb. 1748). Here he published <hi>Philosophical Reflections on the Origin of Animals</hi> (1750), translated Seneca on Happiness, etc. He died 11 Nov. 1751, and desired by his will to be buried in the garden of Lord Tyrconnel.

 </p><p id="paine"><hi rend="bold">Paine</hi> (Thomas), Deist, b. Thetford, Norfolk, 29 Jan., 1737. His father was a Quaker and staymaker, and Paine was brought up to the trade. He left home while still young, went to London and Sandwich, where he married the daughter of <corr sic="a an">an</corr> exciseman, and entered the excise. He was selected by his official associates to embody their wants in a paper, and on this work he displayed such talent that Franklin, then in London, suggested America as a good field for his abilities. Paine went in 1774, and soon found work for his pen. He became editor of the <hi>Pennsylvanian Magazine</hi> and contributed to the Pennsylvanian journal a strong anti-slavery essay. <hi>Common Sense</hi>, published early in 1776, advocating absolute independence for America, did more than anything else to precipitate the great events of that year. Each number of the <hi>Crisis</hi>, which appeared during the war, was read by Washington&#8217;s order to each regiment in the service. Paine subscribed largely to the army, and served for a short time himself. After peace was declared, congress voted him three thousand dollars, and the state of New York gave him a large farm. Paine turned his attention to mechanics, and invented the tubular iron bridge, which he endeavored to introduce in Europe. Reaching France during the Revolution, he published a pamphlet advocating the abolition of royalty. In 1791 he published his <hi>Rights of Man</hi>, in reply to Burke. For this he was outlawed. Escaping from England, he went to France, where he was elected to the Convention. He stoutly opposed the execution of the king, and was thrown by Robespierre into the Luxembourg prison, where for nearly a year he awaited the guillotine. During this time he wrote the first part of the <hi>Age of Reason</hi>, which he completed on his release. This famous book, though vulnerable in some minor points of criticism, throws a flood of light on Christian dogmas, and has had a more extended sale than any other Freethought work. As a natural consequence, Paine has been an object of incessant slander by the clergy. Paine died at New York 8 June, 1809, and, by his own direction was buried on his farm at New <pb n="247"/>Rochelle. Cobbett is said to have disinterred him and brought his bones to England.

He afterwards taught the doctrines of Aristotle at Ferrara and Bologna. His treatise <hi>De Immortalitate Anim&#230;</hi>, 1516, gave great offence by denying the philosophical foundation of the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.

 </p><p id="priestley"><hi rend="bold">Priestley</hi> (Joseph), LL.D., English philosopher, b. Fieldhead, near Leeds, 18 March, 1733. Brought up as a Calvinist, he found his way to broad Unitarianism. Famous as a pneumatic chemist, he defended the doctrine of philosophical necessity, and in a dissertation annexed to his edition of Hartley expressed doubts of the immateriality of the sentient principal in man. This doctrine he forcibly supported in his <hi>Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit</hi>, 1777. Through the obloquy these works produced, he lost his position as librarian to Lord Shelburne. He then removed to Birmingham, and became minister of an independent Unitarian congregation, and occupied himself on his <pb n="265"/><hi>History of the Corruptions of Christianity</hi> and <hi>History of the Early Opinions Concerning Jesus Christ</hi>, which involved him in controversy with Bishop Horsley and others. In consequence of his sympathy with the French Revolution, his house was burnt and sacked in a riot, 14 July, 1791. After this he removed to Hackney, and was finally goaded to seek an asylum in the United States, which he reached in 1794. Even in America he endured some uneasiness on account of his opinions until Jefferson became president. Died 6 Feb. 1804.

He wrote, lectured, and edited, far and wide, and left nearly fifty volumes, chiefly popularising science. Attracted by Newman, he was for a while a Catholic, but thought out the question of Catholicism and science, and in a letter to the <hi>New York Tribune</hi>, Nov. &#8217;75, formally renounced that religion as irreconcilable with scientific facts. His remarks on the so-called Star of Bethlehem in <hi>The Universe of Suns, and other Science Gleanings</hi>, and his Sunday lectures, indicated his heresy. In &#8217;81 he started <hi>Knowledge</hi>, in which appeared many valuable papers, notably one (Jan. &#8217;87), &#8220;The Beginning of Christianity.&#8221; He entirely rejected the miraculous elements of the gospels, which he considered largely a <hi>rechauff&#233;</hi> of solar myths. In other articles in the <hi>Freethinkers&#8217; Magazine</hi> and the <hi>Open Court</hi> he pointed out the coincidence between the Christian stories and solar myths, and also with stories found in Josephus. The very last article he published before his untimely death was a vindication of Colonel Ingersoll in his controversy with Gladstone in the <hi>North American Review</hi>. In &#8217;84 he settled at St. Josephs, Mobille, where he contracted yellow fever and died at New York, 12 Sep. 1888.

He wrote in a book on the gods, &#8220;Respecting the gods, I am unable to know whether they exist or do not exist.&#8221; For this he was impeached and banished, and his book burnt. He went to Epirus and the Greek Islands, and died about 411. He believed all things were in flux, and summed up his conclusions in the proposition that &#8220;man is the measure of all things, both of that which exists and that which does not exist.&#8221; Grote, who defends the Sophists, says his philosophy &#8220;had the merit of bringing into forcible relief the essentially relative nature of cognition.&#8221;

Special Instructions:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="*" align=left valign=top>
<p>The pages have headwords (for instance, if the first entry is "Anaxagorus", there will be an "AN" or something like it at the top of the page). These should all have been removed in pre-processing; please do not add them back.</p>

<p>Watch out the occasional diacritical mark. Proof these as per the guidelines.</p>

<p>No deviations from the standard PG guidelines for proofing or formatting. Looking for a postprocessor willing to mark up the text in PGTEI with original page numbers.</p>

<p>From his own entry in this dictionary:</p>
<p><b>Wheeler</b> (Joseph Mazzini), atheist, b. London, 24 Jan, 1850. Converted from Christianity by reading Newman, Mill, Darwin, Spencer, etc. Has contributed to the <i>National Reformer Secularist</i>, <i>Secular Chronicle</i>, <i>Liberal</i>, <i>Progress</i>, and <i>Freethinker</i> which he has sub-edited since 1882, using occasionally the signatures "Laon," "Lucianus" and other pseudonyms. Has published <i>Frauds and Follies of the Fathers</i> '88, <i>Footsteps of the Past</i>, a collection of essays in anthropology and comparative religion '86; and <i>Crimes of Christianity</i>, written in conjunction with G. W. Foote, with whom he has also edited <i>Sepher Toldoth Jeshu</i>. The compiler of the present work is a willing drudge in the cause he loves, and hopes to empty many an inkstand in the service of Freethought.</p>
